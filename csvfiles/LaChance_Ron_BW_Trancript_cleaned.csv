I did it for, all summer, with two other guys from Canada. They came here and they worked with me for the, all summer, and they'd go back. Now, they live to Augusta, those two guys."
"AL:","What did you do in the brick making process?"
"RL:","I was making the brick itself, striker, it's called a striker. And I was shoveling the mud in the machine, then two guys in front making the brick, and that's, that's pretty much, that's hard work, but I can do it, I can do it at that time. I was younger, so you know. 2"
"AL:","Now, what were you, did you have to wear a bathing suit?"
"RL:","Yes, yes, I do have bathing suit. In the morning, in the summertime, it was not too bad, because the weather was hot then. But that time of the year, around September, October, you have to break the ice on the, and it was pretty cold wearing a bathing suit at that time."

"AL:","So, do you remember some of the people you worked with at the brickyard, that you could talk about?"
"RL:","Well, to tell you, that's a long time ago, but (unintelligible word) a guy I couldn't. Well, my boss, Albert, and another guy, his brother, was nice to us, and they treat us good, and they pay us good, so I liked to work for them at that time. That's, that's pretty much what I have to say about that right now."
"AL:","Now, tell me your reasons for coming to the United States from Canada."
"RL:","Oh, well, in 1957, my wife's sister came to live in Lewiston, and we came to visit them once a year then.

"RL:","Yeah, I lived in Lewiston for forty years, and then in Minot for, right now it's five years in September, this September here."
"AL:","Is there anything about the brick making that I haven't asked you about, that you think is important to add?"
"RL:","Well, the only thing is to prepare the, the clay. The, the, the, it's made with clay and sand. We had to mix it with water, but we can't put enough, just so much water, because it's too, I don't know how do you say that."
"AL:","Too soft?"
"RL:","Too soft, yeah, yeah. So, we had to put the, the exact amount of water in there, and you have to shovel it. It had to put, first you had to put it in the pit. It's a big box, about twelve by, oh, by ten. You have to fill that at night, then in the morning it's ready to, to put it in the machine, and we had to shovel it in the machine, then two guys in front, in front, were making the brick. So, one guy was shoveling behind the machine, and two guys in front to make it, make the brick, so, and the mud, it had to be pretty much good to make that."
"AL:","Did it, did you have to throw out a lot?"
"RL:","Oh yeah, the guy, who in back is shoveling, was pretty busy, because if the machine, if there's not enough mud in the machine, the machine won't work good, so that's why the guy in the back, whatever (unintelligible word) , but he had to finish enough mud to, to make the brick, it come out good."
"AL:","Well, I think I've asked all the questions that I had. Is there anything else you want to add?"
"RL:","Not that I, right now, no, no, not, not much, not much else, no."
"AL:","Great, thank you so much."
"RL:","You're welcome."
