"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) January 17, 2009 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Workers Oral History Project at Museum L-A. The date is Saturday, January 17, 2009. I'm at the home of Valencia Cody in Lewiston, Maine, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu . Valencia, could you just start by giving me your full name, including your maiden name?"
"VC:","Valencia Lorette Cody. My maiden name was Sirois, S-1-R-0-1-S, and Cody is C- O-D-Y."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"VC:","I was born right here in Lewiston , in 1920."
"AL:","Were your parents from Lewiston?"
"VC:","My mother was from Canada. My father came from Canada when he was just a little boy, but his education was in Bath. He worked at the brickyards in Bath."
"AL:","Oh my."
"VC:","Yes, yes."
"AL:","And what were you r parents' names?"
"VC:","My father was Napoleon Sirois and my mother was Alponciene Bilodeau Sirois."
"AL:","How did they meet?"
"VC:","Through friends, I guess, down here in Lewiston. That's how they met. They were married , oh my God , let me see, close to one hundred years now. Wait a minute, 1910, they were married , right here at St. Peter's Church."
"AL:","Oh, that's wonderful."
"VC:","Right here at St. Peter's Church . And I was born at the corner of Bartlett and Birch Street, that big tenement building. I left there at two years old. My father built a house on South Avenue. So I lived there at two, which I know where the place is. I moved out of there in 1990. I had to sell the house because I was getting too old to take care of all the land. I had a brother that, he passed away too. And a sister, my sister was the oldest. She worked in the shoe factory."
"AL:","She did too."
"VC:","Yep, yep. I started at sixteen years old. That was 1936, at Clark Shoe in Auburn. I was there, I think, because they closed in '76, I think that makes it almost forty years in one factory. And then I went over, we had a little factory right here, that came from Gardner, I was there I think about a year. And then I moved over to Falcon Shoe. I retired from there in 1982. I took my pension at sixty-two. I retired from there in 1963, '64, that's when I retired from there. I was there probably three years, four years at the most, then I retired."
"AL:","In the '80s."
"VC:","In the '80s."
"AL:","So, Clark Shoes you began in 1936."
"VC:","I was sixteen years old ."
"AL:","What did you do when you started?"
"VC:","Well, I did bench work. That's what they normally put you on, something slow and easy. I did bench work, and then I would , what we used to call , eureka marking, that was putting the size on the shoe, and it's all little holes. You'd count them by shoe. I did that for quite awhile. I did marking, and then I was asked to go on the floor to be a floor lady for two weeks. I think I was on ten years. I called it the Jewish two weeks."
"AL:","What is a floor lady?"
"VC:","Floor lady takes care of all the people and gives them the work, and sees that the work goes out right. My sister was a floor lady."
"AL:","And did she work in the same shop with you?"
"VC:","Same factory, same room. In the stitching room, we worked in the stitching room . I worked in the cutting room for awhile, but I was getting the work ready for the stitching room . As a floor lady, they move you around sometimes. They need you over there, you 're going to go over there. But I liked it. Clark Shoe was one of the best factories we had."
"AL:","In what way?"
"VC:","In the way that they use the people. It wasn't a sweat shop. I was talking this week with a girl, I said my god, we used to have Friday, Friday afternoon, we played most of the afternoon. They didn't care, and the foreman wouldn 't come up to us and ask whether you worked tomorrow, meaning Saturday, sure, on we'd go. We'd forget we had a half a day. We had good times. Good foremen . First one we had, he was the owner of the factory . He died. He's the one that owned the factory . They came from Massachusetts."
"AL:","What was his name?"
"VC:","Max Ostroff. He was a big man. Big man. Nice man . Falcon shoe, I started the automatic machines that they had, the stitch, did you see them?"
"AL:","No."
"VC:","You never seen them? Roland-?"
"AL:","Roland Landry."
"VC:","Landry, I showed him. And when we had the opening for the museum , I hadn't got them done yet, and Roger called me, he says, Val, aren't you coming down?"
"AL:","I says, Roger, I have no ride."
"VC:","Stay right there, he says, I'm going after you . And he came after me. And I was there for a couple hours. Then all of a sudden this young fellow comes up to me, and he starts saying, now you put that right, no that's not right, you cut your thread , you start over again. I says to myself, who the heck is he. I hadn't seen him for years. I seen his wife every now and then. He says, you don't remember me. I says, my God, what are you doing. He says, everything you showed me, now see what I am. I says, you're partly owner. I says, I want some money out of it. He was a nice kid ."
"AL:","Who was that?"
"VC:","Landry, Roland . Now he's part owner. I'd like to go see that. If I had a car I'd go up and see it."
"AL:","I need to go visit him soon . He's on my list."
"VC:","He is, okay. His wife was in St. Mary's, in the lab. I think she's still in the lab, because I don't go in that lab. I go upstairs when I go in for blood . It goes faster."
"AL:","So he was young when you first knew him?"
"VC:","Yes, him and his wife weren't married . She met him there. And these were machines, automatic machines that you put a piece of, it's a pattern , you put a pattern in the clip like this, and then you put it in the machine and you start it, and it all go skip where it, but we're all learning. Boy, there was a lot of shoes we had to do over. That's what Roland was on, and so was his wife. I showed them both."
"AL:","Falcon Shoe is one of those few companies that seem to have survived ."
"VC:","That's not an old, old factory . I don't know how many, Falcon Shoe, it would be twenty, twenty-five years. Ask Roland when you see him, he should know. Because the owners was what's his name, in the offices, it was his parents that were the owners. Every now and then they would come and visit and look how things were going. Which you can't blame them when you have money invested. But they're still going, and I'm glad for them."
"AL:","I'm interested to know the changes that you've seen in Lewiston over the years."
"VC:","Oh , my god ."
"AL:","You have seen a lot of years of changes. What sort of things?"
"VC:","Beautify. But, I'll say, Pine Street is not Pine Street to me any more. It is just terrible the people they have there. Too bad. Put young ones in there, they don't take care of things. I take care of my apartment, why can 't somebody else. Now the landlady, the landladies now, they use, because it's their son that turned it over to his daughters. They're very, very nice. And the son and I, we always kid each other because I used to go out and shovel, and they plow. And they'd say to me, Mrs. Cody, we don't want you to shovel. I looked at him, I says, Conrad, I says, you plow four, five o'clock in the morning, depending the size of the storm. I says, in front of the doors, we can 't do it, because the plow won 't fit, it's too close. And I says, they come at eight o'clock at night, we have one door to get out of here in case of fire , and that's something I watch. Oh, now he doesn't say anything. I went down the fire escape once this year because this door was locked on me. I had to get down, and nobody around that I could ask to come around to the door and open this door. So anyway, I started down, but you've got to jump from this high, down at the bottom ."
"AL:","Oh, my gosh."
"VC:","I see the firemen , when they come and inspect, when they come here I'm going to tell them that should be longer. That's dangerous. They're the youngest ones and they just moved here, the couple on this side. Besides that, we're all elderly. I'm the oldest."
"AL:","You 're eighty-eight?"
"VC:","Eighty-eight. I'll be eighty-nine in July. And Christmas, this place is decorated, but I don't think next year I'll do it. It's too much for me. I have a god daughter, and her brother and sister-in-law, they gave me heck. They says, why are you doing this. I says, because I like it. Why didn't you call us. You were working. We don't care, we want you to call us. They made me promise, because I put up, the day after Thanksgiving, and I leave it until Christmas day. The day after Christmas, it comes down. And they said, we want you to promise us that you 're going to call us. Because my boxes are all downstairs, I have about ten, twelve boxes and it's getting hard for me to, they don't want me to fall. Because I've fallen , I've fallen and hit the building last fall."
"AL:","That's not good. Can you talk to me about, you said you did bench work when you first went into the shoe shop. I don't know what that means."
"VC:","Bench work, we'll say this is one piece, and this could be the other piece. We cement this here to go on to this piece like this. That's all bench work. All kinds of things. There's bench work, there's folding , there's skiving, there's top stitching , there's fancy stitching. Oh my God , how many more, tappers. Fancy stitching, I never wanted to learn and I had a chance. No way, I will not learn it. That's not the job for me. But I got promoted from where I was. At Falcon Shoe, I retired when I was on the conveyor, send the baskets, which is baskets for the shoes, send them to each one for the type of thing they do. We've got to divide things up. I went on the conveyor. I don't know if you heard of Ida Blais, she passed away. She's the one that brought me in there. She called me in once, she says, I have something for you. I says, what you got. She says, cutting room , they need somebody. No, no, no, not cutting room , I'm a woman . I says, when you take big things of shoe leather, bring them up to your bench, which is that high, I says, no. I said, that's a man's job, not a woman's. I'm not going. She says, okay, I just thought of you. Because I worked in the cutting room , I knew what it was. And not too long after, she called me back, she says, I want you to come at noon, and when you press the button , tell them who you're going to see. And I says, okay, I'll go down. She needed a floor girl. They called it a utility girl. And I went in and I took it. The wages were good. And then when the girl finished on the conveyor, giving the work, she asked me to go on there. She says, you go on there, you 're going to get more money. So I did. I was on that until I retired."
"AL:","Did you develop friendships in the shoe shops, with others?"
"VC:","Oh God yes, we all do."
"AL:","Can you talk about those friendships? Did you meet for lunch, do things on the weekends? How did you-?"
"VC:","Well, sometimes we'd eat together. When I worked at Clark Shoe, that time, it was right on Minot Avenue, where Lown Shoe was, okay. They used to have a cafeteria there. So at noon we'd go, no matter if you brought your lunch , you 'd always go get either a drink or something, and we used to sit there. At the other factories you had to go out, or bring your lunch. And Clark Shoe also. We had voted to take a half hour, go out earlier. Instead of going out at four, we'd go out at three thirty, unless there was something they wanted to hold us, and we did. It was time and a half. I wish I had a shoe here to show you more. I don't have any more shoes from Clark Shoe."
"AL:","You said you donated quite a few pictures that you had to the museum."
"VC:","There's one, you may see it at the museum, I'm putting pieces for the new machines, I'm getting it ready . And that's the one Roger said , I'd of loved to have that if I'd known . He says, that's the picture we would have put on all the papers. I says, I'm glad you didn't know. But it is a good picture. That's it. It's not like it used to be. This was all country."
"AL:","This area, yeah ."
"VC:","This whole area. Down South Avenue, this was country, and the furthest house, I think, was the second house from the corner on Webber Avene, that's on Webster. That was the furthest as it went. This was all farm land . And where McDonald's just built, where Shaw's used to be, that was country. I used to ski down there. I was three years old and I skied . But we didn't have the jumps, we just went down big hills. There was always, like my brother, some of his friends, they'd always make the tracks for us, and we'd follow the track."
"AL:","You saw the Great Depression ."
"VC:","It was just beginning. I remember the Great Depression. I remember Roosevelt. He closed the banks, fast. I'm glad for Obama. I only hope that nothing happens to him . But they make a shield, they showed it last night, I have the news a lot. They make a shield that's plain glass, you think there's nothing there. You should see, they demonstrated it, with the bullets, and anything , it will not go through . He's behind the shield . It's a white glass. They've been doing that, and they're going to do it more and more, for those overseas. My husband was a World War II veteran . He was gone four and a half years before I seen him again . We'd write, but he was in the war."
"AL:","That's a long time. Where was he stationed?"
"VC:","He was stationed in the Philippines, New Zealand, and, because he came home on points once. We got married during the war. He came, got married, then left. They come home on points, for their age and that, and he was one we called old . All the others were younger. He was in his thirties. And then he came home in '45. Left in '41 . My brother was in World War II , he was a airplane mechanic. He was in the Air Force."
"AL:","And your husband was in what branch? VC : Infantry. He left with the National Guard. He was going to be drafted , he was on the first draft, and my brother belonged to the National Guard for years and years. He says, Bill, come with us. He says, I can get you in. So he joined the National Guard, which was better. He went with people he knew there."
"AL:","How did the Depression effect your family, in that you were only in your early twenties."
"VC:","I was not even that. I was still in school."
"AL:","You were still in school."
"VC:","I was still in school. I graduated from Jordan in 1936. I cou ldn't go to high school a lot, because I had to help my parents. There was Depression still there. The only thing, and then we didn't have night school like they have today. I could have gone to night school, because I would have gone, because I like school. There was one woman that used to have a private school. I think she was at the corner of Ash and Lisbon, upstairs. And she went around, she came to my mother and wanted me, not to brag , but my marks were high . And my mother says, I can 't afford it, because we'd have to pay. In two years I would have done my high school. I don't regret it. I do not regret it. My father worked around the clock."
"AL:","You said he did brick work. Did he do other things as well?"
"VC:","Over here, he worked in the Androscoggin Mill, where Mom's is today. My mother worked there too. My mother would work part time. She'd say, I'm going to go help you. And then , of course, I was young, and he says, no, I don't want you to leave the baby alone, and I don't want her to go out, he says, in the morning it's too cold to bring a child to a babysitter. We didn't have the babysitters like they have today, but they found a woman that stayed at the house. She'd stay all week, go home on Friday, come back on Sunday night. And we had one that made cakes. One for us kids and one for my mother and father. We couldn 't touch that one. That was for their lunch . And then my father did some undertaking. He worked for Bond's on Lisbon Street, these people. He did that not long before he died . He did one. So that's why I'm not scared of the dead , I'm used to it. My father always talked about it, so we were used to it. That's nice. Mostly all my neighbors, my neighbor that I had on South Avenue, they're all gone, that whole family's gone. Even the daughter was the youngest, and she's gone now. And she was, Jane must have been close to ten years younger than I was. You feel bad when you see them . They're still young and they still-. You didn't know Doctor Rolston, or do you know Doctor Rolston? He's at the hospice now. He was my doctor for almost thirty years. Nice, nice doctor. And he says to me once, I was saying something , no, no, no, no, no, he says, you 're good till a hundred and three. I says, I will not disappoint you, because I'm a bullocky Frenchman . He's still living, so am I. I've got diabetes, and I control it pretty good. That's the main th ing, because I just went to the doctor Thursday, to the doctor."
"AL:","You said you and your sister worked together in the shoe shops. How long did you work together?"
"VC:","My sister worked till the last day of Clark Shoe, very last day."
"AL:","And you said that was '76 ."
"VC:","Seventy-six, that they closed , because we moved from Port Street, Minot Avenue, down to Troy Street, where the office things is, the office supply at this end of Union Street. There was a factory there, we were there. Clark Shoe was there."
"AL:","That's where Clark Shoe was, okay."
"VC:","Yep, that's where they went. And we didn't loaf, oh my God. When they called me in, when they moved the stuff, and you got to wait. They called me in, I think I wasn't gone a week. Well, will you come in , so I went in and I never come out of there. We had fun . We had a lot of nice people. Still it's your living. I got one girl that worked with me on marking. I met her again on Tuesday, Tuesdays and Fridays, we'd go to Dubois, on Sabattus Street, good food there. And all of a sudden, I was sitting with my friends, and I felt something, so I looked up at her, I said , what are you doing here? And I knew her friend . I knew she's the one that told her that I was there, because she's blind. She's my age, was the same age, I'm in July, she's in August. And I feel so bad to see her like that. She had her home here on Noble, and her brother in law sold it. She's now at Marcotte Home. I said , so Florence, how do you like it? It's small. I says, yes, because I went and visited once with one of my friends. I never would put anybody, I wouldn't put my cat in there, not in those rooms. Maybe some bigger rooms, but my God . I don't think, it's not as big as this, the whole three rooms . So imagine, you have your TV to put, and little things, no, no, no. And she's crippled to. I met th is girl in Togus. I used to volunteer in Togus. I got over fifteen thousand hours there."
"AL:","You are kidding. That is a lot."
"VC:","I got awards. I go in, I used to be in the nuclear medical, and then x-ray. Then Dottie, which she was in the office for volunteers, she called me. She says, I need you Val. I said , what. I need you in the office. I says, I don't have the education . You're all right, she says, don't worry about it. So I went to the office and I came out of there, how long has it been? How long have we been out of there? Ten years, twelve years. It goes so fast. When she got through , I did too. I go for Christmas parties. I went this year again. I have some friends that call me, and one of them called me for something , because I used to take care of fudge to bring up there. I had a girl that used to make fudge for me, for the veteran 's home. Then I says, if I don't go, they don't have fudge . And now they stopped it. It's got to be the food that they have. So Ann called me and asked me, Val , you need fudge? I says, Ann , I don't take care of this anymore. I says, if I don't go up, they don't get it. I says, call Joanne Hebert, she's the state president this year. She says, okay. So she called Joanne, and she made it for her, and then Joanne called me, she says, Val, how'd you make it? I says, take the box and divide it. I says, just give some to each veteran's home. They were going to York, South Paris, because her husband died in South Paris. And I says if you want some, take some too. I used to make myself a little box. Anyway, now, and then she says to me, Val, would you like to go to Togus? Oh , would I love it Joanne. She says, I'll pick you up. She knew I always went up. And this changed so much. It's not the same at all. They get the good care, because my husband died there. My brother did too."
"AL:","So that had a special connection for you."
"VC:","Yeah , because, what I would do is, in the morning, even in the hospital I'd do that, they're all around you getting you ready, take your bath or shower, and medication. So, you're in the way, to me. So I used to go just a little bit in the morning , because I would go in for six o'clock. So I'd go in and see my husband a little bit, then I'd go back, and at noon I'd go back. At first I used to go at night, before I left, then my brother was living, right before I'd leave to come home. And then I says, oh, no, he used to say, I want to go home too. I said, well Bill, I'm going to do that some more, and then I'll come back. Then his nurses told me, don't come back now, he won't even remember. So I didn't go back. She says, it's harder on you. And when he died, it was on a Saturday, and they called me and I went up. I had time to see him before he died . He couldn 't talk to me anymore. He was seventy-two years old and his hair was black as coal, not a gray hair. They say, the father, LeClair, was a priest, and he was a local boy, and he was chaplain for the National Guard when they left, and he knew Bill well. We'd have reunions, and the father would say to me, Mrs. Cody, I says, yes. How come Bill has such black hair? I says, you know, you don't use the style polish any more, so he uses that. He used to laugh. He was a nice, nice priest. They all were good priests. I wish I could find that album."
"AL:","So, we talked about some of the processes in which you worked in the shoe shops. Do you have any other observations or recollections of your time in the shoe shops that I haven't asked you about, or haven't known to ask you about? Anything ever happen that sticks out in your mind?"
"VC:","We had fires. We had a fire ."
"AL:","Tell me about that. VC : Clark Shoe, on Troy Street. It was in the winter, and they had big fifty gallon barrels of cement, what we called rubber cement. That was explosive. The white cement, it wouldn't bother. It would just start. This woman went to fill her little bucket of cement, because you didn't go to start working, her slip, it was cold, the static of her slip turned the vat on. That's when they hollered , fire. Everybody would move out from that section . But most of them would go and help the firefighters. Lewiston would come faster than Auburn, who were right around the corner. It was fun . We'd make fun out of it. And they used to say, what a good group they are, boy, they can watch . Oh yes, we didn't want nobody to get hurt. Most of the time it was in my sister's section because that's where the shoes started. Cutting room to stitching room. The stitching room , the cutting room , they get the patterns, and they cut them, and then we assembled. They have top stitchers, that's more towards the end of the room. Let me see. Comes down , my sister divides the work, and the people pick up their work. They're all on piece work. Then they clean all the things up and go back to work. That was excitement sometimes. But she didn't get, she moved to Florida . She retired, her husband died, she moved to Florida. That one I'd like to see. You know, you like to see the old ones. Now, my beautician worked with me when Clark Shoe, she was going to beauty school when Clark's would close. She opened her own place. She used to be down on Birch Street. That burned, she had a fire there. Now she's right up here on Eblon. That's who I go to, and we talk at different ones. Because I have one, I says, did you see that Yvette Currian died? She says, yes, that was my cousin's wife. What you want running around for. And another thing. We'd say you'd be working on one part of the shoe, and I was working on the other one, and I'd get caught up, and I'd go home for the rest of the day. I wanted my friend with me, we'd go help , get you caught up, and then you could go home too, and we'd go to the movies. In the afternoon, if we had an afternoon off. But once I got on the floor, there was nobody going to the movies, I had to stay there."
"AL:","Is there anything I haven't asked you about that you th ink we should add?"
"VC:","I don't think so."
"AL:","Thank you very much."
"VC:","You 're more than welcome."
