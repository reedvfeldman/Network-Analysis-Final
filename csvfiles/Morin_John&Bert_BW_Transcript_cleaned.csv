"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) September 5, 2007 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Brick Makers Oral History Project. The date is September 5th, 2007, we are at the Museum L-A in Lewiston, Maine, and today I have with me Bert Morin and John, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. Bert, could you start just by giving me your full name? Bert Morin: Ethelbert William Morin, Junior."
"AL:","And where and were you born?"
"BM:","Nineteen thirty two, in Danville, April 21st."
"AL:","And, go ahead."
"BM:","In what they call the old homestead."
"AL:","Was that the Morin Homestead?"
"BM:","The Morin Homestead, yes."
"AL:","Is that where you grew up?"
"BM:","Basically, that's where we started to grow up. We were only there several years, and they moved but always lived in Danville, different locations."
"AL:","What did your parents do for work?"
"BM:","My father worked at the brickyard and my mother was a homemaker."
"AL:","How many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"BM:","One sister, Annette, she was three years older than I, lived in the same, the same place as I did for the first several years at the old homestead. Then we moved out of Danville in '30, the late '30s, and moved to Auburn, which was at the time, was part of Danville, or Danville was part of Auburn, about the turn, the turn of when they divided."
"AL:","John, could you give me your full name?"
"JM:","John Baptist Morin ."
"AL:","Where and when were you born?"
"JM:","I was born in 1936, in Lewiston, Sabattus really, right in my mother's, my mother's mother and father's home, that's where I was born."
"AL:","Did you grow up in that area? JM : No, I was born in, I mean brought up in Danville, right near the brickyard, Danville itself. Then from there we moved to Washington Street and, which wasn't that far from the brickyard. I'm still there, yeah."
"AL:","So did your father work at the brickyard as well? JM : Oh yeah, oh yeah. He was, both of them, his father and my father, both were part owner of the company, along with other brothers and sister."
"AL:","Now, how many brothers were there?"
"BM:","Eight."
"JM:","Eight and one-."
"BM:","Eight brothers and one sister."
"JM:","And one sister. They were all in the fam-, all, it was a family organization."
"AL:","Had, had the brothers' father owned it before that?"
"JM:","Yes, yeah."
"BM:","He, he started it."
"JM:","He started the business, yeah, and then all the boys went and worked in it. In the Depression time, it was pretty rough for them, and they all worked in the yard to keep it going. This is how come it grew, kept growing."
"AL:","So tell me about when you all got involved. Was it a part of your life forever, being around the brickyards?"
"BM:","Well, I think it was supposed to be. No, we started at an early age when we were in school actually, in grammar school, and doing little odd jobs that, you know, were the easy ones and working up to, of course, business practices as we went along. But we both got to the point that we went on our own for a while, and sooner or later we ended up back there because it was family, the family business to begin with and has been since."
"JM:","At nine years old, I started sanding bricks. I had a job, that was when I was not going to school, that is summer vacations."
"BM:","Yeah, vacations."
"JM:","It really wasn 't a vacation, you still had to work. But they started , we both started when we were just kids. We had a job."
"AL:","So did you learn pieces of the process, and then do more and more?"
"JM:","We just worked into it. The older you got, the harder you worked. And you did, you, you, you had to pull your weight. Just the way they did."
"AL:","Can you talk to me a little bit about what the different steps are in the process of brick making?"
"JM:","Boy, I mean we'd-."
"AL:","Or the pieces you remember?"
"JM:","Oh, we can remember it all."
"BM:","Well, there's a lot of processes in the beginning to the-."
"JM:","There's a lot of processes. You're starting up on the clay banks, that's where it actually starts, is up on the clay banks, where they process the clay there by harrowing, and then after that they used to scrape it and bring it up to the pits. And the guys used to, the men that made the bricks themselves, they'd put it into a big pit, with sand, water, and clay, and that was the mixture of it. And then of course, the making of the bricks were up front with the big machines. It was a completely done by hand back then. Go ahead, Bert, if you'd want to fill in, you go fill in any time. It was a-."
"BM:","Well, basically, the clay had to be soaked overnight to reach a consistency that it would be able to make bricks, and that had to be done everyday, so the next day you could make with what you prepared the day before. And then it went down through what he called a machine. It was nothing but an auger, a horizontal auger that pressed clay into the bottom of the machine. And then when it was molded, what we called molding, you insert a mold , the pressure fills the mold, and then you have, what do you call it?"
"JM:","You mean-?"
"BM:","Just the press-."
"JM:","The press?"
"BM:","The press, the mold, yeah."
"JM:","That was the machete, what we call it in French."
"BM:","Yeah, but that was what call, you called molding process actually."
"JM:","Yeah, molding. BM : You inserted the mold in the press."
"JM:","Do you have those pictures that we brought the other day? Are they all processed? We could go through this with you."
"BM:","(Unintelligible phrase) some here."
"JM:","Oh yeah, you got some."
"AL:","These are the real earlier ones."
"JM:","That's the earlier ones. Then we could see that works. But I brought a whole bunch of pic-, well, if they processed them. But if they did, we could go through with them much easier with those pictures."
"AL:","Yeah, I don't know."
"JM:","I wonder if they got them done, because we could through with, with those photos in, in steps."
"BM:","I don't even see them."
"JM:","Yeah, I should have, but imagine they have it."
"BM:","Yeah, well. JM : If you want, if you, yeah, well, those are so old , those are, this is back when, all right. This would be the making, the making of brick. This is where they pressed out and molded, and then after that they were put on these little, these little carts. And they used to run from here, there were two, there was another, there would be another that would be working with him. He's already dumping now and com ing on back. So there was always two in the front and one guy shoveling in the pit, which was mixing the clay, water and sand ."
"BM:","That shows it."
"JM:","There you go. Now, this is the follow up where, see the man that's just, he's dumping the molds right there, and there's one filling the molds right. He'd be back at the front of the machine. This, this is what we used to do, we were very, sanding. And you have to sand the top of them, because if the sun hits these bricks when they're wet, they'll crack in the sun. So this is the only reason why you put the sand on was to take and stop the sun from cracking the brick."
"BM:","Drying too fast."
"JM:","Yeah, they were drying too fast."
"BM:","You get sunny days, the real hot and mugged, muggy sunny days, and anything that was cracking (unintelligible word) was waste, and you didn't make a lot in those days."
"JM:","Now, they would dry. You 'd have them out here until you could put your fingers on them without squeezing, you know, so they would dry right. And we used to, what we called hicking, and this where these gentlemen that put out ten or twelve thousand bricks a day did this every day, when it wasn't raining that is. They'd make ten or twelve thousand bricks a day. Going on, on the other side of this, this hick, and there's a hick there, going on the other side and pick up the day before's bricks and hick them. See this here, this here? Now, this would dry, this would help dry. Notice this little space? You see this little space is in between them? Okay, and that's for- ."
"AL:","Yeah, to keep the air flowing through?"
"JM:","The air flowing through them and drying them, and this would take, well, if it was, if it was muggy, it wouldn't, it would take longer. Now, let's say probably three to four days, then we'd put them into the kiln."
"BM:","The basic thing was, there was just so much area that one machine had, that today you'd use this yard and you'd strike the ten thousand bricks on this yard. The next day, you 'd have to use this yard , that you made the day before, and you had to pick it all up and put it in hicks like this to get it off the ground, so you could do the same thing again. So it was just one day after another, and in the middle, of course, further on down the line, it will show you where you had to get rid of them."
"JM:","This is what he is showing you right here. This was a different, you'll see, okay, there would be a place here, where they would lay the brick down, and on the other side here, beside this hick, on the other side, they've already probably had them the day before. And this one also shows you, there's one that we had at that time, we used to have five machines, and there was one there, two, the third would be over here, and then we had another one over here, and then they had one on this side, that you wouldn't see in it. But that's back when they had five going, striking machines. From there, from those hicks, they would go, all by wheelbarrow, and they'd be whee ling them"
"BM:","I can't get over those (unintelligible phrase)."
"JM:","From here, and from , from here, from the hicks, wheel them up these, up these platforms that they used to set up, and what we called setting brick, setting them into the kiln, which would be -. I don't have one of those."
"BM:","You've got (unintelligible phrase) in your file."
"JM:","But there's probably some in there."
"BM:","Why don't you give them to me, and I'll keep up with you?"
"JM:","There's one here."
"BM:","That's a good one over there."
"JM:","Yeah, but that don't, that's the end, just the end of it, that's the end of it."
"BM:","Gee whiz, it's the same thing all the way through."
"JM:","Well, no, that was the very, where we stayed up (unintelligible word), but that, they would wheel them into these areas, like this here. That, that's where the other pictures will come in real good, where you could see them. And this is where they would set them. And you notice all the little spaces in between?"
"AL:","Yeah."
"JM:","This is so that the heat would go through the whole kiln, and a kiln looked like this. This is where they burned them. That's way, way, way back. It's all together different. Because you're looking back here, we did motorized vehicles. You know, (unintelligible phrase) done by horses."
"AL:","So this would be probably the early 1900s?"
"JM:","Yeah, somewhere in the fif-, the teens."
"BM:","Well, he started, grandfather started this brickyard in 1912."
"Unknown:","Nineteen ten it says."
"BM:","Ten? God, I'm off again."
"Unknown:","Nineteen ten on this one."
"BM:","Really? What about the, what about the Oliver?"
"Unknown:","In Danville, 1910, after two years in the Austen Yard, John Morin bought the Oliver Brickyard,-."
"BM:","The Oliver Brickyard."
"Unknown:","And the Oliver Brickyard, and the operation (unintelligible word)."
"BM:","It's not the same one."
"Unknown:","Until 1929."
"JM:","Well, they started, they started at-."
"BM:","They started at the Oliver Yard, and then he bought the farm ."
"Unknown:","That was grandmother's family, wasn't it?"
"BM:","Oliver, yeah. Grandpa, grandmother was (unintelligible word) ."
"Unknown:","Grandmother was an Oliver."
"BM:","She was an Oliver, yeah."
"JM:","It started out with (name) , and then our grandfather's the one who took over. He made it work. All of them, they worked hard to make it work, that's, that's the thing. BM : That was bull strength, perseverence."
"JM:","And during -."
"BM:","Had to be dedicated in those years."
"JM:","The Depression years were really tough on it."
"BM:","His father was, was one of the dedicated ones that carried on from his father, that was the hardest worker, twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. And he, I don't care if he was sick or otherwise, he went to work."
"JM:","There were no sick days."
"BM:","There were no sick days."
"AL:","Well, it was hard work, wasn't it?"
"JM:","Yes, it was."
"BM:","Oh yeah, it definitely was, it, I don't think there were too many professions that were as demanding as that was, because it was so, no matter what you did today, it had to be done tomorrow and the next day. And there was no, the only time that they had any let up, as far as being out there doing what they did the day before, was the fact if it ra ined , then they had all the backup that they had to do that they couldn 't find time to do. They had to get their own wood , process everything that was in the process of doing this."
"JM:","We had a picture of one (unintelligible phrase) something, somebody in the pit."
"BM:","The sand was something that had to be brought in. Everybody depended on everybody else, and they had quite a team."
"JM:","I have seen, wouldn't see that today from anybody that was, one of the owners of a company, but I've seen my dad come in, in the morning at five o'clock, and find that there's a, that we were missing one of the, we call these guys strikers, and he was probably back then in his forties, yeah, I'd say he was in the forties then, come to work, make sure everybody was working, and check and we have, we have a man missing, put his bathing suit on and get right in and do this. That's how dedicated that they were."
"BM:","It had to go every day."
"JM:","It had to go, because it was only a short time you made bricks. You started making in April, and when the frost came, a good killing frost, that was the end of it. But from April until the first frost, that's it, it had to go. The wheels had to move."
"AL:","So what did your parents do during the winter?"
"JM:","They worked in the woods to get the slabs and everything to take and-. BM : The wood to burn in the pro-, the burning process."
"JM:","For the burning process (unintelligible word) . There was no, not really a let up, and then they started a lumberyard too. BM : Well, they, they started the lumberyard, primarily for the wood products."
"JM:","This comes in rotation. I'm pretty sure that's the way they got to play. BM : Yeah, we'll set them in rotation, because they might not (unintelligible word)."
"JM:","Okay, remember where we're saying we started in, on the clay banks? Okay, those, what they call harrowing part, right there. That was breaking up, that was breaking up the clay, so that they could pick it up and scrape it, which he's doing right. Here was another."
"AL:","Now, what was your dad's name?"
"BM:","The same as mine. I'm junior."
"AL:","Okay, yes, that's right, Bert. And Joe?"
"JM:","Yeah, that's Joseph-."
"AL:","Was an uncle?"
"JM:","Joseph Morin."
"BM:","Was an uncle."
"JM:","Yeah . And this one here is mine, that's my dad, that's, his name was Albert. Okay, I was hoping we had one of the scraping, but we don't, but we (unintelligible word) , this is, do you want to continue now and talk?"
"AL:","Yeah, yeah."
"JM:","All right. This is the, on the clay banks, this gentleman right here, his name was Randall Crocker, he, he's just like family. He'd been with them since they started. That's all clay bank here, which was when they were breaking it up, so that they could scrape it, and then bring it to the pit, like this here. This is the pits that they were filling. See the water running?"
"AL:","Yeah. JM : And these guys are shoveling into the pit. This is all clay."
"AL:","That's all clay, okay. JM : All clay here, it was dumped here, and then they shoveled it in and kept it, see if you go up here, you'll see the water on, on the, on the clay. It had to be kept that way. You're, you're watering it at the same, and keep that mixture just right. The sand comes in, when you're putting it into the machine itself. That's what, this is pressing it out, this is the press right here. Let me get a better picture here of it. It goes down through the machine, through the process. Okay, there's where they're making, right here. There's the mold."
"AL:","Oh, wow, they're covered in clay."
"JM:","Oh yeah. Now, you started this in April , so you can imagine, it was cold. All these gentlemen that made these bricks, believe me, a lot of them got arthritis."
"BM:","Kick the ice."
"JM:","This is unloading, but there's the machine, and there's the wheel. You see that plug right there, see that's the machine?"
"AL:","Yeah."
"JM:","And there's little propellers in there that broke up that clay. And it would come down here, and right here is what, this is, this is a foot pedal here, where you, you push this handle in, that put the, that put the mold into the machine, okay. When you lifted this handle, that put the mold into the machine, and then there was a press that you stepped on and then pressed the clay into the mold, okay, and then you took it out, swung around , this was after it was a little more modern than those other pictures, and it went along a cable like so, down and it was unloaded and put into cars, these cars right here. Instead of drying like we used to here, that used to go into cars and, and placed into sheds and dried that way. But that's the old way, there's a guy sanding , and this is the newer way, and that's gone out now. They don't make it this way anymore. If I remember right, okay, it goes into the drying sheds, from there. In these sheds, it took probably, oh, a week to dry, then you could bring them over to the next step, and his is what I call, this is setting, setting the bricks into the kiln. They were put on a conveyor belt and they ran down, and that is what this man is doing right here, see. And there is your kiln itself, right here. This is where from green, they turn to red and dark, and you get your colors, and he's doing the same thing right here. That's setting the base down here. These are the arches, where the wood's going to go in, right here, and you can see where they're all spaced so that the heat will rise and it burns it evenly. If there's any questions -."
"AL:","I do have a, as, as you're making the bricks, does it build the kiln, or is the kiln already there?"
"JM:","No, no, no, no, this the kiln, this is, this, the bricks themselves are the kiln ."
"AL:","Right, okay, yeah. JM : Yes, because you're going to feed the wood in here. Everyone, most all of these, are going to be shipped out onto a job after they're done, after two weeks of burning."
"AL:","Right, and then you're building another kiln?"
"JM:","Yeah."
"AL:","Then another kiln? JM : While this one is being burnt, they'd be making another kiln."
"AL:","Right, okay."
"JM:","Maybe two of them at one time."
"BM:","Yeah, they start with an open, an open kiln ground, we call it kiln ground, which is basically from there down. This is completely removed . Anything that's not saleable is removed, right to the bottom, with the early process, okay, here it's completely done, and then this was all set up again with bricks that you see these people moving in with wheelbarrows, then this is what they call setting. Somebody has to set everyone of these in a certain way, where the heat can get up through it and the color can remain the same. It get, the burning process gets to a point where it almost melts. In some cases, it did, it gets too hot. If, if there was what we call an arch, this is an arch, if that was, the brick was set too close together or whatever, it was a hot spot, then that would get to a point where it would melt, and then you'd get a big fused hunk of clay, that you could put on your front lawn, you know, and a lot of them did. We still have some."
"AL:","And I, I remember somebody talking about having to climb up on the kiln to do something and it being really hot, and having to wearing wood on their feet."
"BM:","(Unintelligible phrase), yeah."
"JM:","Wood?"
"BM:","No, no, no, no, no."
"JM:","No, they'd never put wood , you'd burn that."
"BM:","Well, no, no, what she's saying is that you had, this, this all had to be enclosed with an outer layer, like making a, making a roast, the idea, but you had to completely make an outside area to keep the heat encased in the, in the kiln itself. This is not the final process. Yeah, you can see the out-, well, you can't really see it here."
"Unknown:","Was it called scoving or daubing?"
"JM:","Scoving, yeah, but it was -."
"BM:","Scoving and daubing. She ain't got there yet."
"JM:","No, that's brick bath."
"BM:","We'll let him continue, before he loses his train of thought. JM : I've already lost it. Okay, we got that part done, and all right, now, you see those two layers, okay, we were just talking about scoving, or about being able to take and bind the thing up so that you could keep the heat inside, right. Okay, you see this is the green brick here, if you look right over here, that's what I, we were trying to tell you right here. This is what they call scoving. It's two layers of brick, that are already cooked, already done and they're nothing but broken brick. Three quarters and under is what we used to use for this here. This is to keep the heat in this part of the kiln, because these here are all going to be shipped out, most of them will be shipped out. But this side here, this is to help keep the heat inside. On, after this is all up, then we use clay, water, and sand again, and put that over this. That's what we used to call daubing."
"AL:","It's daubing?"
"JM:","Daubing."
"AL:","Okay."
"JM:","You put that on the outside layer and it sealed everything."
"BM:","What do they call that today?"
"JM:","What? Daubing? I don't know, it's probably today you call it dubbing. BM : No, no, it was-."
"JM:","But you did-."
"BM:","Like terra cotta. The same idea, but nothing more than clay and sand , and you daub it on, that's why, daub it on. JM : And you used a trowel, a hand trowel, and then -."
"BM:","Yeah, like you, you , you go-."
"JM:","And this is what seals."
"BM:","That's what's used for walls."
"JM:","That's what made this thing all sealed up, so that it was really almost airtight, except the only place you wanted air was going through the arches, that would force the heat up through those little cracks that's everywhere. Okay, now, we get into the burning part. We blinked the setting part, and we went through the making, we went through the setting, the drawing processes, what have you, now, we get into the burning part. And it would take anywhere from, anywhere from eight to ten days normally, to burn one of these. And as you can see, every day we would go through, this would probably hold us for one night, what you see in here a little bit, but we have to go through probably as much as that again for a twenty four hour period."
"AL:","So that was a lot, lot of wood to be in supply."
"JM:","Oh yeah, you had to keep it ready at all times, because it did use a lot of heat, a lot of wood. It all depends on how many arches you have or how big the kiln, the kiln was. If it was, if you had a twenty arch kiln, most of them made, very seldom we made one less than eighteen to twenty. The one at the end of the year may be the smallest one, where we couldn 't put anymore, we couldn't get anymore to put in."
"BM:","Well, you never know with the last one."
"JM:","No, but really you'd try to get eighteen to twenty, twenty two holes, the arches, the holes that you fed it with."
"BM:","Going back to the wood processing, when he said they started a, actually a sawmill, well, it was because they couldn 't buy enough slab wood, which was basically pine, very little spruce in those days, but it wasn't like today. You, when you, when they sawed lumber, they take a slab off the side of it that was half as big as the log, it didn't matter. Today, of course, they use every little thing they can. But they started the sawmill, Uncle Joe, which is the one that you saw there, was in charge of the lumber. They would buy any wood lots that they could buy, and of course, they sold the lumber that was processable through the mill to, a lot of stuff went out of state, actually, that they produced that was too good to burn in the kilns. And then they bought almost everything from every sawmill that they could buy from, just to keep up with this. And the wintertime is when they went into the woods, in areas that they bought, land that they bought and so forth , for the timber and the hard wood. This is basically what all of the, the brick makers and things went to do in the wintertime, is cut that hard wood. Then it was brought into the, the yard . Most of it had to be split. Now, that started out being done by hand, four foot lengths. You know, that's pretty demanding by itself. But to get enough material to burn a year's wood here, they had to really, you know, keep up with it as far as buying it anyplace that they could and produce their own as much as they could. So I can't, I'm, I'm trying to come up with figures of what basically that they used for cordage at the end of the year, and I, I don't, I don't recall. JM : It would vary on the, on the weather too, and everything."
"BM:","Oh yeah, it would vary a lot on how many days they burnt and how many kilns they burnt."
"JM:","That all depended on a lot."
"BM:","But to get a magic figure, Norman could give us that."
"JM:","Yeah, probably."
"BM:","If that was necessary."
"JM:","But that's, that's about it. In a lumberyard, another thing was that you didn't have to lay everybody off and all that."
"BM:","That's correct."
"JM:","That was the big thing."
"BM:","It was an income."
"JM:","It was an income."
"AL:","So you kept the, the people yea r round."
"BM:","Well, yeah, because you get into, try get into the, the stopping of the making process, which is not much later than it is right today, because when it starts, the frost starts, oh you going getting by, in those days, everything was outside. They had to figure it pretty close to say, well, we don't, we can't make anymore, because we're just going to throw them away and, but they were so short, that they'd always try. If they could put out ten thousand and save five thousand, to get that last little bit, they would. But from mid-September-."
"JM:","That was it."
"BM:","That was it. So basically without the lumber industry, you know, that's a long span from the middle of September to the last frost of the year, which you're going to get in April. And I remember, when I was striking, in the what they call the new machine, that we'd kick ice out of the, out of the troughs, where, where basically the water flowed, kick ice out of that to get started in the morning , and we were in a bathing suit so. J M: And bare footed ."
"BM:","Bare footed , yeah."
"AL:","So you all did even that process? JM : Oh yes, we did them all."
"BM:","(Unintelligible word)."
"JM:","We did it all."
"BM:","I know he did and I did. We went right from the first place (unintelligible phrase)."
"JM:","Oh, (unintelligible phrase). That was the only way you could be in the family, you know, you had to start."
"BM:","Well, I was told several times, we were to make, you know, what do you call it?"
"JM:","We had to make an impression on the other guys in the crew."
"BM:","Yeah, you had, you had to be superior to the others, no matter. We had a guy there that was about three times the size us, you know, muscleman, Mr. Hercules, and we were expected to do what he did, and I'd give up that, trying to do that after a few years of aches and pains."
"AL:","Was he somebody that was there for a long time?"
"BM:","He was an employee, yeah. This, this guy was unbelievable, and he died as big as a pencil, yeah."
"JM:","His trouble was, was this here, (unintelligible word)."
"BM:","Oh yeah, I, I -."
"JM:","There's so many gentlemen that-"
"BM:","Tell me, (unintelligible phrase) ."
"JM:","Worked hard in this, but as, you know, I told you about arthritis, it will, doing this kind of work, it was, it was tough on a (unintelligible phrase). And these fellows that worked, when you work on these kilns and you 've, you can't, you wouldn't be able to operate the way they did back then, you know, I mean the environmental (unintelligible word) to do this stuff. But these, you can see the smoke coming out of here?"
"AL:","Umm-hmm ."
"JM:","I don't know who told you, about they wood on their feet, it was so hot up on top of those damn kilns, that, that, the wood would have burned. It used to burn the leather of our shoes. And to get up there with the gases that were coming out, was unbelievable, which was (unintelligible word) and hot, oh. We used to have to go up there and close what they call was a flat laying, it was a flat layer of brick over, over the top of this kiln. It wasn't left open on the top, like you're seeing right here, that, the flat's already been taken off. But you lay a brick down upright, and then what you did was, you laid them flat ways on the top to hold the heat in there. And as this brick shrunk as you were cooking them, the bricks would get tighter and tighter, and we had to take and, and, and get up there and close them up again, have to take some out and then close them all up. Oh, it was quite a thing, and that took, the guys that worked up there would be up in there probably an hour or so, and, I mean that wou ld be in and out, in and out, off the kiln, because you couldn't stand up there too long. But oh, man, those poor guys, that, that was unreal. I'd, if there's anymore questions, this is, this is the burning part, and as you see right here, there's a, this is what we called a dressing. And you had the, you have to close one side of the, the brick of one side of the kiln. See, that's what they're doing there, they're dressing this side here. So if they left this side open, this would side would be closed . In other words, what we'd do was close this side of the kiln off, and leave this one open, so it would force the heat from this side to here, that would lower that. The lower this side of the kiln would be, brick would get hot enough and start to shrink down, and you could see, actually see the hole when you get up on top, you have to go up there and check all the time, and look at how it is coming down, because they're shrinking now. You know, I mean this, like the third or fourth , fifth , sixth day, you can actually watch, in about a six to eight hour period, you can see it, how much you've come down. And you can't come down too quick, because then you'll freeze all the bottom, where they'll be all stuck together, so you have to have a chance for it to get so the heat will rise and get up there. So if you close this side of your kiln and you left this side open, it would, you know, this side being open would force the heat over to this side and you'd bring them down here. And then when you figured , you look at it, you say, whoa, I better close this side, and we'd have to come over here. Close this side and open this side, so you could get this side to come down. It was quite an operation, really."
"AL:","Now, did you make both water struck and wire struck?"
"JM:","No."
"AL:","Or just -?"
"JM:","Just, we just made water struck here."
"AL:","Water struck?"
"JM:","Just water struck, right."
"AL:","Yeah."
"JM:","Dennis made both."
"AL:","Okay."
"JM:","They made a wire cut and they also made a water struck. They had one machine of water struck."
"BM:","Yeah, one, yeah, just one."
"JM:","Yeah, one machine. At, at times, when we were hauling brick to Limestone and hauling brick all the way to New York, northern Maine, all over heck, we had actually two yards. We had a yard here and in Lewiston too. I think it was the Bergeron Brick that they bought."
"BM:","Could be, it's where my sausage company is now. That was the old brickyard , and I think that was Bergeron."
"JM:","That was the old Bergeron Brick."
"BM:","See, the, the company bought all of the small brickyards, all the way up through, there was Brooks Brick, there was Bergeron, there was -."
"JM:","Liberty's."
"BM:","Liberty. They all got to the point where they couldn't survive, because they couldn't make enough, and of course, as time progressed , people didn't want to do this kind of work, if there was anything else that was possible, they didn't want to do work in the brickyard. But I will say, and I always did , that the Morin Brick Company put a lot of people through college. Summer jobs, all become just right, you know. They'd hire all of the college kids out of school."
"JM:","And high school."
"BM:","And, and high school, yeah, a lot of high school kids also, that worked the summer, because it was summer work, and th is, like you'd get today, with, you know, with McDonald's and all these that hire the kids for the summer. And they always left at a poor time, because it wasn't done yet, but they went back to school, you know, that was a hardship, but it put a lot of kids through college."
"JM:","Yes, it sure did."
"BM:","A lot of prominent people here with that work, that went through this process, in this, in Lewiston-Auburn."
"JM:","They got quite an education down in here."
"BM:","Oh yes, part of it, I'll tell you that. It's (unintelligible phrase), most of them are glad are be where they are today. JM : I, I think I am."
"BM:","They earned it."
"JM:","Our story wouldn't work today, but we'd have seven, eight, nine guys that would come in for a job, right? My dad would come out of the office, and he look at them in the morning. He'd say, okay, put your hands out, men. They'd, they'd look at their hands. He'd say, I got to tell you one thing, you can 't make it, son, you've got to handle four bricks at a time. Well, I can handle two. You can't handle two here, this is, we handle four bricks here. And I mean, you wouldn't be able to do that. That would be discrimination today, but back then that's. No, you got to handle four."
"BM:","Everybody did their job, or they didn't work there."
"JM:","Yeah, that's right. That was one of the things-."
"BM:","School of hard knocks, you might say."
"JM:","That's what it was."
"BM:","It was quite a process."
"AL:","Do you have, I mean I heard that there was quite a bit of comradery among people working in the brickyards, because it was such hard , hard work, and they worked in teams, and -."
"JM:","Umm-hmm."
"AL:","Did people tend to stay for a long time, or -?"
"JM:","Oh, yes."
"BM:","Oh, yes. The originals were there until they couldn't be there."
"JM:","That's true."
"BM:","We had an old gentleman, by the name of Duchaine, he's in here somewhere. He was eighty two years old and he was still setting brick, at eighty two years old ."
"JM:","Right there, that's him right, right there."
"BM:","That guy had fingers on him that were. Randall was the same way, Randall's a big, big gentleman. He had big, long, big hands, long fingers, ideal for brick making, believe me, because mine don't bend anymore. My knees don't bend anymore, my back don't bend anymore. No, it was very bad for cold water and so forth . Mostly everybody that were in the brick making part of it, very, very few ever got through without some kind of-."
"JM:","An ailment."
"BM:","Ailments as far as arthritis, things like that, which is understandable."
"AL:","Were there any, do you have any stories from , from your time in the brick-."
"JM:","Oh, we could tell you a lot of stories, and some them we can't put on tape of some of the guys that worked there. It was-."
"BM:","Oh, it was part of the process. I mean in those days, you know, you talk about liquor and so forth , if they didn't have it, they'd probably been dead. You know, the whole process was the old fashioned way, hard cider, whatever, but it, it was the growing up process."
"JM:","Oh, I could tell you a little, just a kind of a stupid little story, but. Remember I was telling you about daubing the kilns with the (unintelligible phrase), it was kind of a joke. When a new guy would come in, and we would say, okay, we're going to start with, got to daub that side of the kiln today, okay, let's get the crew and get going. So we always tried to take and get a new guy that would work along beside one that's been doing it for years, and he would give him the idea of what to do. That was fine when you're on the ground level, right? Now, usually, he would say, now, how we going to do the top part? And that was the story that went on and on, from year after year after year, and the guy with the experience would say, well, you've got to get a daubing hand. A daubing hand? Yeah, you go in that, you go in that shed and you 'll find a daubing hand. And oh , he ran over there and he'd look, and of course, he'd be gone about four or five minutes, and he'd come back. Well, what am I looking for? I looked in there, I ain't seen no hand. And then we'd all start laughing, right? There's no such thing, and but around the corner all the time, dad would come around the corner. He said, what are you doing? Oh, we sent the guy for a daubing hand . He says, that's getting to be old. He says, you know how much that's costing us down here? He says, to run around looking for a daubing hand? I said, you pulled it on us. It was funny then."
"BM:","One thing you didn't tell, I was a processor. When the wheeling process went in for setting , that we had what you the base, the lower toss and the upper toss, which was put in, in increments in height. You started at the bottom, and a lot of the people that wheeled, what we called wheeled, were taking it from those hicks up these planks, whatever, into the kiln ground, and then they set their own bricks in the bottom, in most cases. They're all able to do this. But when it got, you see the toss, what we call the toss began right there, you can see the dividing line from the arches?"
"AL:","Yes."
"BM:","And then the brick changes in direction?"
"AL:","Umm-hmm."
"BM:","Well, this was the lower toss."
"JM:","You can see it here. There's the lower toss."
"AL:","Oh, yes."
"JM:","See the (unintelligible word)."
"BM:","Okay, you-. At that point, was from a wheelbarrow, so you'd have to toss four bricks. You grabbed two bricks off of each side of that wheelbarrow, put them together and toss them up to the next guy to be able to set them. Well, that in itself was quite a chore. When you got to the upper toss, you had to stand on the wheelbarrow, one foot on each side and do the same thing, and toss them twice as high. And when it got to the point where most of them couldn't toss those four bricks, you did it two bricks at a time. Now, two bricks at a time can make a kiln like that, there's, there's two things. It takes a long time, or you got to be awfully fast. And a lot of times, they'd get these little gigs going, where I can toss them faster than you can catch them, and that was what you call, what you said in working in teams. Some of these people would work together, and some of them couldn't. But they had people that were, no matter what they did, was right. I mean they'd done it for so long, they can't make mistakes. But that was part of the, and th is was usually, I've seen this happen. There were several individuals there that would start at five o'clock in the morning every day. They'd come in, they'd work on these open yards, they'd put out twelve thousand, the magic figure was ten, but they would put out twelve, you know, because they were could, they were so used to it, that they could crowd these things in, and make every little space available useable. And of course, there's one person that had the yard, that, that, that striked these, he had to go out every day and harrow. He had a big cement roller, that he had to roll out. You had to pulverize this clay. It comes out of the ground hole, and you have to dry it and pulverize it, you had to go up there two or three times a day. It would dry and then he'd roll it with a roller and he'd pulverize it to a point, where he could bring it down to the pits and we'd shovel it into the pits, for soaking process. And you had to get it pretty good , because the next day you really suffered if you didn't get it right. It was either too hard or too soft. And if you got a slump, you had a hard day. It had to go just the same. So that process was, was in that era alone, was time consuming for these other people to do. But these guys would come in and put out twelve thousand bricks, be done by no later than eleven o'clock, and a lot of them were ten o'clock they would do it. They'd go just as fast they could, because whoever got done first, filled their pit first. Everybody else waited . He wouldn't go to the second pit until this one was full. So if you were really slow, five a day, you were down there late in the afternoon or suppertime filling your pit. It didn't stop there. These guys would fill their pit, then they go and grab a wheelbarrow and wheel until suppertime, and a lot of times until dark, until we couldn't see to set them, to set the bricks up. If you couldn't, you know, you couldn't pass them up there unless the guy could see them coming . They'd do this every day, from five o'clock in the morning until eight or nine or ten o'clock at night. And they were all working piecework. And I mean some of these people, you look at them, you say they're not capable of doing that. They were wire. they was, they were just as tough as nails. Unbelievable."
"JM:","It was all in (unintelligible phrase) , you stop and you think-."
"BM:","Oh yeah, (unintelligible phrase)."
"JM:","You'd see them making, let's say you did ten thousand, you had to move them, you had to be out of there to make room , so they could make the next day's, off in the open yards. So that meant you made ten thousand, your filled your pit for ten thousand, you wheel ten thousand, and they set, one set up with two wheelers."
"BM:","There was, there was a three man crew. This we didn't mention either. There was one guy that shoveled, what we call shovel the pit. You get in there and bull strength and ignorance, you might say."
"JM:","That's what it was."
"BM:","You had a barn shovel. Have you ever seen one of those barn shovels, they use in a barn? They're about that wide."
"AL:","Yes."
"BM:","Well, that's what you, you had to get in the pit and shovel into that (unintelligible word) hole, by the shovelful, that's the only way."
"JM:","There's a shovel right there. End of Side A Side 8"
"AL:","It's now on side B."
"JM:","There's a shovel right there."
"AL:","Okay."
"JM:","So you can see the size of it."
"BM:","And that one man had to shovel and keep that (unintelligible word) going for the two men that were down front. So you're on a one to two basis here. And there you go again, they were always trying to outdo one another, so if they thought they were going to do a gig and, you know, you wouldn't keep up, a lot of them couldn't keep up. If you really wanted to produce out in front of that machine, the six bricks that come out of there was about two shovelfuls, or maybe three. And they slap them in there just as fast as they could go. Well, you know, you have to do a lot of shoveling in a pit that's fifteen feet long. You know, when you're going towards the end of the day, you got to go get it. That's only way you can go get, get it, is to go get it. It doesn't come to you, and you still had to shovel that pit. So that was a long process, but a day's work. I tell people that today and they don't believe you. It's unbelievable."
"JM:","Yeah, and you just stop and think, at that time, in those days, they were making good money. That's why they did this. The money was really, for that time, it was. And we really did , it was-."
"AL:","We can pause for a minute."
"BM:","Yeah, we won't, we won't, well. He's right in a way. I mean-."
"JM:","It's good money."
"BM:","We worked for ninety cents an hour, in most cases, just general labor, and ninety cents an hour, back along then, would bring you about thirty to thirty three dollars a week. Of course, the tax structure wasn't great at the time, but there was still some taken out of your pay. But thirty three dollars bought something then. There weren't a lot of jobs, and that's why this prevailed, because if you wanted to work, you could get a . Page 22 of 29 job here. If you didn't, you had to go somewhere else, and there wasn't any other place to go. So basically, it was, you know, hard work, but you got paid for it. The people that did what I told you, as far as striking is concerned and did their own gig, all worked piecework, so at the end of the week, it's, the, the best they could do was what they got paid for. And some of them, in those days, brought out some pretty good checks. JM : Oh, yes."
"BM:","But they earned every bit of it."
"JM:","Oh, yeah, they did."
"BM:","When you do two weeks' work in a week, you've done-."
"JM:","There was no such thing as an eight hour day."
"BM:","(Unintelligible phrase). JM : No such thing as an eight hour day. No such thing as a five or six day a week."
"BM:","And of course, all through the summer-. JM : (Unintelligible phrase) rates."
"BM:","All through the summer, it was a twenty four hour process, as far as burning is concerned, so you had twenty four hour shifts on the kiln. Well, as John said, a lot of times, you know, a guy would get fed up with this and didn't come to work, somebody had to do his job. It took so many people to do that. So if you, that was the hardest part. The first part of the year, you'd hire people, they'd work a day or two, sometimes they didn't make it that long, and they'd disappear. I've seen times they didn't even come after their checks. They didn't want to show their face. I mean but you had to keep filling in. That was a kind of a process that was hard to do. You didn't take names, all right, you didn't go have interviews. If you happened to be there in the morning, and they were looking for somebody to go to work, they'd, they'd hire you, but you had to be there. No such thing as giving them a phone number, if you 're short, give me a call, no such thing. Whoever's there got the job. So it was a hard process for everybody, it really was, hard time, but-."
"JM:","And operated with about a hundred and twenty five , about a hundred and twenty five me, you tried to keep that amount. At times, it was even higher, a hundred and fifty."
"BM:","You'd, you'd took, you'd took a shortage of one thing that wasn't too critical, and those people had to go work wherever you placed them, and most of them were capable of doing anything , if they had been there for a year. Some of them, it didn't take that long. Some of them, it took them ten years and they still didn't know but."
"JM:","They didn't want to, don't want to get too smart."
"AL:","I'm, go ahead. BM : So that was quite a process. I mean that some, and of course, the shipping part of it was the same way. You had to do exactly opposite as you did to put it up. All right , you ahd to take it down. It's like building a house. You build it, piece by piece, and then when you come to take it apart, take it apart piece by piece. That was something that didn't pay the bills. It's disposing of what you took up, but we reused it again. Everything that we took out, broken brick or whatever, were put up, as you said, as scoving on the next kilns. Had to clean up the thing. The shipping processes were the truck drivers, his father, when it comes time for the, everything was put on dump trucks. So when the dump trucks come in for the day, from the previous delivery, you had to stop what you were doing, go and load it up again for the following day, or a lot of them made two or three trips a day. So that was a, more or less of a shipping thing."
"JM:","It was a shipping division."
"BM:","So it didn't stop there. Of course, it didn't stop until the body went up and-."
"JM:","Then it was quick coming back and reload it."
"BM:","Yeah, and then there was so much work in between, the cleaning process, the broken brick process, the cleaning of the kilns, because they were right behind you all the time. You burn a kiln, you wait for it to cool, you start to ship to certain places that certain colors, different in the kilns. So different colored bricks, different quality you might say. University of Maine, Orono -"
"JM:","You had Colby-."
"BM:","Colby College."
"JM:","Colby blend."
"BM:","They had to have this special blend that we're the only ones that could supply it, but it wasn't like, oh, well, I'm going to start, I'm going to load that truck right there. Well, you'd have to put one picker over there, you'd have to put one picker over here to blend the colors, and they had to know what they were shipping, or they wouldn't, they'd refuse them, we'd get them back. And they were real, real fussy. If you look at the brickwork on those colleges today, Bates College is the same way, you don't see a bad brick anywhere in a wall, not a crack, not a malform, whatever, and you had to work hard to be able to get that particular type, quality, and it wasn't all that way. Yeah, you had different colors. You had what they call light hard, that you built chimneys with. All the interior walls here are made with that. They didn't really get cooked enough, you might say. All the outside brick has to be col-, now, I noticed , I was noticing the other day on a couple of these buildings here, that there is a lot of light brick in there, what they call light reds , that the only reason they're there is because you couldn 't supply anything else. They had to build the building."
"JM:","That was years and years ago, 1800s those."
"BM:","Yeah, that was when they first-."
"JM:","That was before (unintelligible phrase)."
"BM:","I don't know, I get, I don't know the history of Bates that well, but I think a lot of this came from Canada. I'm not sure."
"JM:","Could be."
"BM:","I'll have to ask Norman about that."
"JM:","Must have come down by rail."
"BM:","As I said, I-."
"JM:","Because they were really the first ones that really get going up in Canada, because that's where they most of the, because that's where our grandfathers got the idea of it. BM : Well, actually, yeah."
"AL:","Oh, really? Is that how (unintelligible phrase)?"
"BM:","They came from Canada."
"JM:","Yeah, that's how they got started. That was back when it was the Oliver Morin Brick. It was up there in Canada , and then they moved their operation down this, into the United States."
"AL:","Oh, I see, so it started in Canada and came to Maine."
"JM:","Actually started there. In fact, I think it was Oliver that had, and grandfather went there."
"BM:","I never researched it enough to really know. I know they came from Canada, they started in the Oliver thing, Oliver got out of it, grandfather stayed in it, and it was a family concern for his kids."
"JM:","He had , he had a brick company, he built a brick company with his kids."
"BM:","Yeah, it was a family thing."
"JM:","Yeah, it was a family operation."
"BM:","It was documented that way and stayed that way until '76."
"JM:","Yeah, something like that."
"BM:","Seventy seven."
"AL:","Is there anything that I, I haven't asked you about that you think is important to add, that I haven't thought of asking?"
"JM:","Oh, gee, I don't know. I'll tell you one thing. Anytime that you have a problem, if you're going to have a, you know, you need somebody to come over and help you out, just, just give us a call."
"AL:","Yeah."
"JM:","We'll be, she and I will be gone for at least a week or two now. We're going to Jersey, and we'll be going for a couple of weeks, but Bert's handy."
"BM:","I'm available anytime."
"JM:","And I'll be back."
"AL:","And what's-."
"BM:","Remember I told you about the roll , preparing the clay on the banks?"
"AL:","Yes. BM : It was harrowed. There's a cement roller that they dragged behind a tractor, and they'd drag it all over this, this clay that would then -."
"JM:","What you see here. BM : When you start, when you start on a clay bank, it's like this, it's hard."
"JM:","Harder than heck."
"BM:","Dried clay is hard , it's like the bricks when they dry, it's the same idea. You have, you had to break it up, and this is what they rolled it with, and you can see the hicks here in the yard. This had to be done every day."
"AL:","Yeah, it says, the old Oliver yard , he is where honest John Morin-."
"BM:","The other guy. JM : Not this one."
"BM:","His grandfather."
"JM:","I was named after him."
"BM:","That's just a private joke."
"JM:","Yeah , and there is, there is a difference there too. It says honest."
"AL:","So they're talking about the Oliver yard -."
"BM:","The Oliver yard."
"AL:","Bef-, the first, the first nineteen years of brick making business before moving to the Webb farm ."
"BM:","The Webb farm is where it is today."
"AL:","Okay, right out past Washington Avenue."
"BM:","That's where, yeah, and they moved there nineteen years. Does it say the date? I don't know."
"AL:","No."
"BM:","Yeah, I've got to, got to get this for you."
"AL:","Oh, yeah, definitely."
"BM:","Got to get that. That, that's got more history than we told you probably."
"AL:","Well, great. Is there anything else that you want to add before I turn this off?"
"JM:","I don't-."
"BM:","Not (unintelligible word)."
"JM:","It would be if you, you know, you think of something or somebody asked you something, don't-."
"AL:","I know people ask me about stories, and so I'm always trying to elicit stories that aren't (unintelligible word)."
"BM:","We've got stories."
"AL:","That aren't too infamous."
"Unknown:","Yeah, your father had a story. When he'd come back from having a heart attack and found two guys out on the slab pile."
"JM:","He would , he'd been out sick for quite a while, he had a heart attack, and the new men, that we had hired, had never met Albert, which was dad, never saw him. So finally when he got feeling better, what?"
"BM:","Just tell them that you were in charge at that point. You've lost that. JM : Yeah, well, I was getting to that."
"BM:","Well, you should have started with that."
"JM:","And I happened, and I happened to be in charge while he was gone. So I had the new guys that we hired, you know, the last couple of weeks or what have you, I used to send them out to get the wood . And if you've got a hundred and twenty five, thirty men, you know, you're around the yard all day long, and you're, and the slab piles were quite a ways away, so you get a chance to go out there that often and check on them. So they'd have a chance to have a break, while they were out there, right? They'd be sitting on the slab pile, and my dad come over, you know, and he was feeling pretty good that one day, and he says, how's everything going, John? I said, everything is going pretty good, Dad. Well, he says, that's what he says, I'm going to ride around . He had a little jeep at the time, and he jumped in his jeep, and he was riding around. He went out and he sees the guys sitting on the slab pile. So he went out and he says, how you doing, boys? Oh, okay, everything's fine. He says, well, have a cigarette. So he, he sat there smoking a cigarette. He says, how's everything, how do you like working here? Oh, it's not too bad, but that son of a gun that they call a boss up there, he is something else to work for, he's after us all the time, usually he's around here looking, you know. Dad says, is that right? Well, he says, that's good. He says, he keeps you guys on the ball (unintelligible phrase) . Yeah, you got to watch out for him all the time. He says, you don't have to watch out for him, it's me you'd want to watch out for, I own this damn place, and he says, you better get to work, you've had enough time off. It's one of those little (unintelligible word) stories that -."
"AL:","Oh, yeah."
"JM:","But we had a lot of fun down there. There was all kinds of stories. We'd see some of our guys come in, in the morning, with their eyes crossed. You can't be here today. Why can't I be here? I had other plans for you, and it didn't, you aren't going to work out. Oh, we had some, we had some pretty good times there."
"AL:","Great. Thank you so much, both of you."
"JM:","Oh, you're very, very welcome."
"BM:","You 're welcome."
