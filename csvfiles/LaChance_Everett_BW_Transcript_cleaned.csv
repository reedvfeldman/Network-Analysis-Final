"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) February 6, 2009 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Brickyard Workers Oral History Project at Museum L-A. The date is February 6th, 2009, and I'm at the home of Everett ""Skip"" Larrabee, is that correct? Skip Larrabee: Close enough."
"AL:","In Auburn , Maine. And if you'd go ahead and give me your full name?"
"SL:","Everett Whitmore Larrabee is my name, Skip is my nickname."
"AL:","Your nickname, yeah."
"SL:","That's the name I use, most people know me by that."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"SL:","June 16, '41, in Auburn."
"AL:","In Auburn , did you grow up in Auburn?"
"SL:","Yes."
"AL:","Have you lived here all your life, or?"
"SL:","All but about five years of it."
"AL:","So how many children were there in your family, growing up?"
"SL:","There's me, my sister, and my brother."
"AL:","So three of you. And what did your parents do for work?"
"SL:","Farmed."
"AL:","Did you have your own farm, did they have -?"
"SL:","The farm at the foot of the hill is where I grew up, I was born in the house on the next road over."
"AL:","Oh, so you were born at home?"
"SL:","Yup, never made it to the hospital."
"AL:","Now tell me, what was it like growing up rural , I mean because this was very rural at that time when you were growing up in Auburn and living on a farm . Did you have many neighbors?"
"SL:","Well, the nearest neighbor from here was half a mile away."
"AL:","And what kind of a farm was it?"
"SL:","We had cows here, raised milk for Oakhurst Dairy."
"AL:","So you grew up learning how to milk cows, I bet."
"SL:","Oh yes."
"AL:","And running a tractor."
"SL:","I started driving tractors when I was six years old."
"AL:","Six years old , wow."
"SL:","I was too small to do anything else."
"AL:","Is that sort of, I mean because I know later on you drove trucks early, and was that sort of something that was just in your upbringing that you really enjoyed?"
"SL:","Yes, I drove tractors here on the farm , and trucks in the hayfields all the time, haul hay. I was used to driving. Before that, we had horses, we farmed with horses. First tractor I think we had was in '48, it was an 8N Ford, it's sitting it out in my barn out back."
"AL:","Oh, wow. So what age did you go work in a brickyard?"
"SL:","I was fifteen , I believe."
"AL:","Was that your first job?"
"SL:","Well, second one, but yeah."
"AL:","And what brickyard was that?"
"SL:","Morin Brick."
"AL:","Now, the Morin Brick Yard was where?"
"SL:","Danville."
"AL:","In Danville."
"SL:","Yeah, which is part of Auburn, but."
"AL:","So age fifteen . What jobs did you do at that age?"
"SL:","I drove a tractor in the clay bank most of the year, and we scraped the clay, we harrowed it, then you had , sometimes you had to crush it with a big cement roller, and then you would scrape it up and either put it in a pile or put it into, right into the striking pits usually. If you've got more than they needed, then you piled it up and they had a building to put it in so when it rained you'd have some dry clay to fill the pits with. And we'd load it into dump trucks and haul it over to the pits."
"AL:","And how many hours a day did that entail? Was that early morning stuff, or was it through the day?"
"SL:","Oh, we started like six in the morning, got done, could be six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock at night."
"AL:","Oh, so it was all day."
"SL:","Yeah, I used to make a dollar ten an hour when I started down there, and I used to bring home between ninety-five and a hundred dollars a week take-home pay."
"AL:","That's a lot of hours. And so how many years did you work there?"
"SL:","I can't remember for sure, but I think it was two or three the first time, then I went and done something else for a while, then I went up to Mid State Brick in Sydney for, I think it was either three or four years I worked up there."
"AL:","What was it called, Mid State?"
"SL:","Mid State Brick. The bookkeeper from Morin Brick owned it."
"AL:","Okay, so he did the bookkeeping at Morin and then he had his own, it was a smaller operation?"
"SL:","Yeah, he started that up on his own, he wanted to get into it on his own, and he did for I think it was either three or four years, something like that."
"AL:","So you went down there and worked, did you drive there too, or did you do other things?"
"SL:","When I went to Mid State Brick I drove, he bought a brand new truck and I drove that. First new truck, I was twenty years old. Used to haul brick down to Massachusetts. We went, we used to even go out to Provincetown, Mass., out near the Cape. It was six hundred miles round trip."
"AL:","And was that to sell brick?"
"SL:","Yeah, they made them in Sydney, and I'd haul them down there and deliver them. They was building a building for New England Telephone down there."
"AL:","And you said he only operated that for three or four years?"
"SL:","Yes, he got murdered."
"AL:","Do you know any of that story? Was that, that must have been kind of scarey."
"SL:","Someone, he was, in the spring, I believe early in the spring, he was down there keeping an eye on the temperature outside, because they had made some brick, if they're green, they'll freeze, he was watching to make sure they didn't freeze , and if it got too cold he'd call some help in and they'd start spot type heaters up, to keep them from freezing . And so (unintelligible) they had a picture of the new building they built down there, new offices at the time, and he was sitting there doing paperwork. Well they put some pictures in the paper of the big safe, and they come down to rob him, not knowing there wasn't any money in it, and they murdered him. Somebody he knew."
"AL:","Did they ever find out who did it?"
"SL:","Yes."
"AL:","Oh, they did . So that business closed because of that?"
"SL:","The one up in Sydney closed because of that, because he's the one that run it, he's the one that had the money invested in it."
"AL:","And what kind of bricks was he making there?"
"SL:","He made the old fashioned struck bricks on the ground up there, to match the old buildings that were around. A lot of the schools down in Massachusetts, colleges and stuff, had them type of brick in it, so he specialized in making that, it was something different than Morin so they didn't compete against each other. He didn't want to compete against the company he worked for."
"AL:","And so then did you go back to Morin later?"
"SL:","Yeah, later I come back down, I got done up there in the fall, I was building my house down here at the time, and then I worked in the mill. I think that went (unintelligible) , then the next spring I went down to the brickyard and worked down there for another year or two, or two or three years."
"AL:","And doing the same thing, or?"
"SL:","No, I was running the (unintelligible) truck, taking care of the strikers. They had four striking machines at the time, and we used to take the green brick out of the, where they struck them, put them in drying sheds, take the dry brick and take them over to a canopy which, they'd run them up a conveyer belt and set them in the kilns, and take the empty ones back to the striking shed. So you went around like, yeah, pretty much."
"AL:","Did you get to see the brick making process from your job?"
"SL:","Oh, yes."
"AL:","Can you talk about it a little bit, what it was like to work in the brick yard?"
"SL:","It was hard work, it was good pay at the time. They hired an awful lot of people that were either getting out of high school, college kids, because they would be out of college, they'd want a summer job, and by the time the summer job was over they was going back to college so it made a real good place for college guys to work. It was hard work, but it paid a little bit more than working in a shoe shop at the time, so a lot of people who were going to college worked there. They'd hire, I don't know, fifty or more kids a year down there. I call them kids, I mean teenagers. They worked down there."
"AL:","And who was the owner of Morin Brick?"
"SL:","There was brothers, there was Fred - I can't remember the other, John I think, I'm not sure what the other brother's name was. Those brothers had owned it, and Lachance Brick, down in Gorham, are relatives of theirs. I don't know just how that goes, but."
"AL:","Well , what they like to work for, the Morin brothers?"
"SL:","Fine. It's hard work, but as long as you did your job, that's all that's required ."
"AL:","I've heard people say that sometimes it was kind of a rough job, there were some, there could be rough characters that worked there."
"SL:","Oh, at times, yeah. Wasn't that bad, I mean, yeah."
"AL:","Are there things that I haven't asked you about the brick yards that you can add? People's personalities, or you know, how the things worked?"
"SL:","(Name) was one of the nicest men you'll ever meet. He always was just nice to everybody that come in there. I think he done most of the hiring. You know, I got along with just about everybody down there. If you could teach the kids- the kids were on piecework, most of them, the ones that worked in canopies, the strikers were on piecework, the setters were on piecework. They had a crew down there, they just didn't set very many brick, and kind of my job was to try to get them to set more, so if you show them how easy it is to do it, they went from setting like, I don't know, fifteen, twenty thousand brick a day to setting forty thousand brick a day, but they earned twice as much money. And once the got a couple of paychecks, that's all it takes. You don't have to do nothing, they'll do anything they can to help you after that. Or they'll stack the pallets up on the cars so they'll fall over, so if you pick them up (unintelligible) and you back out, they'll fall , and you got to stop and pick them up. Because they want to run out of brick so they can sit around. After they get a couple good paychecks, (unintelligible) to tip one of them over, they pick them up, because they don't want to wait. That's the difference. My crew was setting forty thousand, the other crew was setting twenty I think. You got two crews that set them. And once they got a taste of money, it's."
"AL:","And it's getting the system down, too?"
"SL:","Yeah, it's one of the little tricks that make your job easy. If you always do it the hard way you 'll never, you'll fight with it all the time and you just, it's just to work. If you get so it's easy for you, then you don't work any harder and you make twice as much doing it. You're just a little busier. You might as well be busy for the ten hours you're there or the twelve hours you're there and make some money, as to be there and earn half as much money and, you know what I mean? I'd rather earn two dollars an hour instead of a dollar an hour, so. And there were some that wanted the money for college, so they wanted to earn a lot of money in a short time. That's a big incentive."
"AL:","So how old were you when you left the brick yards for good?"
"SL:","I don't know. Must have been thirty-five or so, thirty-five, something like that."
"AL:","And what did you go on to do?"
"SL:","I went to work as a mechanic for the City of Auburn, I did that for about six years, until they told me I had to be a foreman."
"AL:","You had to be a what?"
"SL:","A foreman."
"AL:","A foreman? And you didn't want to be?"
"SL:","I didn't want to be a foreman. So I got done and went to drive trucks again."
"AL:","Well great, thank you so much for your time."
"SL:","No problem."
