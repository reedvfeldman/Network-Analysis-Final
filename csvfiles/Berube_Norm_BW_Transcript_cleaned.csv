"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) October 18, 2007 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Brick Makers Oral History Project. The date is October 18th, 2007, and I'm at the Museum L-A, with Norm Berube, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. Could you start just by giving me your date of birth? Norm Berube: November 7, 1930."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"NB:","I was born in Lewiston."
"AL:","And did you grow up there?"
"NB:","Yes."
"AL:","And what was it like growing up in Lewiston at that time?"
"NB:","Well, I think looking back, it was an exciting time. I think I have a lot of good memories about the things that happened during those years, you know. There was a lot of good th ings that happened, that today I don't th ink we'd take appreciation of it, you know. We don't appreciate it as much . The hard work, being able to do things with very little, we didn't have too many toys, and we'd do, we picked up whatever we could to play with, and we seemed to be very content. And the families were big in those days, obviously, you know. Education was not a primary thing in those days, especially people usually work in the shoe shop and the mill, that kind of thing. Simple life, it was very simple, and family was oriented, very much so, because in the community, everybody knew one another, so to speak, family wise, the relatives, cousins, nephews, and that kind of thing, we used to visit one another all the time. People didn't go out of the state too much, or even out of the city too much. They usually established themselves here. And local mills and textile mills was very fluent at that time, there was quite a, quite a few textile mills, and there were a lot of shoe shops, they were very well known throughout the, throughout the states. And so people used to stick together, we used to visit one another, relative wise, that was enjoyable, you know. The simple things of life, I guess, I guess the simplest thing in life is free, really when you get down to it. You know, you can go out and in the park, and you can enjoy the band, they were playing there every week, and that kind of things. And if you could go to the beach, well, you have to take the, at the time it was the railroad, railroad cars, it was, it was, it was available. Later on, obviously, the bus you could go to Martin's Point, Sabattus, and things like that. During the weekend, there wasn't, not too many people even then, in those days. When I was born, when it was early 1935, there was cars, but not everybody could use, afford to, to ride in the car. So I had a very good upbringing, I felt, you know, looking back and that kind of thing, it wasn't, I don't think we took things for granted too much."
"AL:","How many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"NB:","Oh, I had two brothers, Larry and Bertrand. Larry, matter of a fact, just passed away about a month ago. He was living in Connecticut. Bertrand is not too well, he's in a nursing home. And I had a sister, (name) , and she's by herself, and she's in, she's doing well. And that's the family right now."
"AL:","Did the church play a role -?"
"NB:","Oh yes, definitely, it was, it was the best Franco American, we're Catholics, obviously, and we had to make sure that we did the right things. Of course, we went to Catholic ch-, schools. You couldn't help but doing, well it was the Catholic, only it's big, you know, and it was very important to follow the obligation days and everything else that the Catholic teaches you. Of course, I went to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. I was born on Bates Street, and right next to, right across the street from Saint Paul and Saint Peter School, and across from the street from there, there was a public school, Coburn, Coburn Public School, then all you had to do was cross the street to go to school, and there was a convent over there, the Saint Franciscans, the nuns used to teach us, up until the fourth grade, after that it was the brothers of the Sacred Heart, and you went up to the eighth grade. After that, I went to Saint Dominic High School on Bartlett Street, started out, so you could continue your education in a Catholic environment in those days. It was an exciting time because the school was so close, the church was close by. And I remember an incident, I don't know if I should even mention that. Me and my brothers, during the spring, people used to play marbles, and in the schoolyard, a lot of times they play, during recess they played marbles, and a lot of marbles used to go, for some reason, over the wall, and they went into the, the nuns' building over there. And my brother and I one day, we said, why don't we climb the wall, there's always some marbles up there, you know, they were collecting. We climbed the wall and we climbed down, and with a few marbles we pick up, all of the sudden we got caught by one of the nuns that happened to be passing by. And she said, what's your names? So we give her our names, she had a little notebook, and she put our names down. I thought that would be the end of it. So the next day in class, the sister says, start telling me, the people about other children not having as much as other children, and this and that, and she said, it would be a good gesture, charitable wise, if those that had marbles, that would be willing to make some contributions for those that didn't have any, you know. And some of the kids went up in the hallway, where they hung up their clothes, their coats, and they wanted to pick up some marbles and give it to the sister. The sister put them all together, and she came over to my desk, and she presented to me the marbles, and I was so embarrassed, because obviously the sister must have told the other sister about this incident, you know, that we were looking, that we didn't have any marbles. I suspect that some of the students were not too happy about where their marbles went. So that was an incident I, I remember very well from those days. And we moved from Bates Street to Blake Street, just one street upper from that, two twenty six Blake Street, I recall that very vividly. They had five big apartment houses there, between Maple Street and Birch Street. They used to call that the LaPlante Building. Mr. LaPlante, from years back, had built big houses, apartments not houses, but apartments. There were two apartments going down below the street level, down like this here, and then they were four stories high, there were two apartments on each story, so they had ten apartments in one of those buildings, and they were all alike. I think today if you go there, I think there's still three buildings, like those buildings are still there, these apartment houses, three of them out of the five that there was. It was quite an oddity in the sense that you saw five buildings all built the same way up there, and it was on two twenty six Blake Street. It was always exciting, an exciting time."
"AL:","Yeah, so now, at what age did you start working in the mill and brick making?"
"NB:","Yes."
"AL:","At the same time, or one before the other?"
"NB:","Well, let's see, when I was living at two twenty six Blake Street and maybe I was around twelve or thirteen years old, and I'm going to mention something about the brickyard . There was a brickyard up Bartlett Street, where right now Hudson Bus is located. There's Bartlett Hill, at the end of Bartlett Street, where Hudson, there was a brickyard there. Some of us youngsters, during the evening when the brickyard was not working there, we used to go there and play ball in that field. So that was my first experience. I never saw them do any bricks there, but they had the machinery and it was a brickyard. Now, obviously, a brickyard is located where there's clay, that's all. You had to find some clay. In some places, there's more clay than other places. And over there, they have a certain amount of clay, obviously. And what, what somebody ends up (unintelligible word) or do, would say, this would be a good place to start a brickyard , because of the availability of the clay. That's how you locate the brickyard. And that was my first experience with just what a brickyard was. I mean, they had the machinery there, but obviously at night, nobody was working there, so we used to go over there and play. It was close by to Blake Street, you know. Then I went to Saint Dominic High School, and I went the first year. By the second year, being a sophomore, my father says, well, do you think you want to go to work in the mills or want to go to school? I don't know. And they didn't push too hard about going to school in those, you know. And school didn't interest me that much . I was doing fine, but it wasn't interesting. Well, I think I'll go work in the mills. So my father was working in Number Three Mills here, rayon weave room . That was not cotton, it was rayon . It was a cleaner environment, rayon is much cleaner. My father was a shovel repairman, he fixed shovels. Shovels go through the (unintelligible word) . My brother was working there as a cleaner, and I started working there as a cleaner. It was my brother who showed me what to do, to clean and oil, cleaner and oiler, clean the looms and the oil the looms. There were three hundred looms in that room , and they had, each cleaner had to take care of one hundred looms. So when they took the (unintelligible word) , we used to go over there and clean the looms with rags, cleaning the, the gears and the rods and everything else, and the floor, the grease and everything like that, we used to clean that. Then we used to grease the wheels again, the gears, and then we'd oil, every place that needed to have some oil, and th ings like that were part of our job. So I started that, and obviously after a while, you got interested in being, going a step higher, which was really, in those days, what you'd ask a supervisor or the overseer, that you were interested, you know, in learning how to weave. And what they did is put you with the weaver, and then after a certain period of time that we, that we'd asked the weaver if that individual learned or not, that he could operate a set of looms, and then that's how you became a weaver. And when I became a weaver, there was an opening on third shift, of course, obviously, chances are that you couldn't go on first or second shift. Seniority, there was a question of seniority. So I went working on the third shift, and met a good friend of mine. His name was Norman Cote. I just found out that two years ago he passed away, he was living in Florida. My best friend, I would say. So he was a weaver also. So we were weaving on the third shift, and that's when one day he says to me, Norm, how would you like to earn some extra money? So, why not. I must have been seventeen, eighteen years old at that time. I said, doing what? He said, we could work at the brickyard, at Dennis Brickyard. I said, where's that? He said, it's off Washington Street in Auburn. So I said, okay. So I went over there, then they hired you on the spot, there was no application, nothing like that. Dennis Brickyard was operated by Mr. Dennis. I can't remember his first name, but he had four sons. I remember Larry, Romeo, Ernest, and there was another one, and they had just came back from the second World War, most of those were in the service during the second World War. At that particular brickyard, they did two types of bricks. One is known as the water struck. That's the most commonly known. Brick makers, brick makers are strikers, they call them. That's where you have a yard out the re, a big yard, and then they call it water struck, which, for some, whatever reason. can explain that a little later on. The other type of brick, they were making, they were wire cut bricks. It was a different type of brick. My first experience was on the wire cut, they told me to work there. How that works was that you have a hopper, so to speak, where they put the clay and the sand together, and it's like a process by mixing it together, goes down the machinery. I, I call the hopper, I don't know of any particular name, that's on top of the machine itself, that makes the bricks. And my first job was to work in the hopper, and put in sand in the hopper and clay. That's really difficult to do, the reason being that you can shovel sand, but you cannot shovel clay. You have to slice it with your shovel. Imagine how difficult that can be, you just don't dig in there and try to lift it up. And then you have to have, for instance, they would tell you, for every two shovels of sand, you have to have a shovel of clay for the mixture. And the person down below, on the wire cut machine, would regulate the water. So it takes clay, it takes sand, and it takes water to make the bricks. And he would tell you, for instance, that there was too much sand or too much clay. So you had to be, yell at you up there, you know, hey, too much clay, so be careful, try to get the right mixture, so he would tell me that, and he would regulate the amount of water. Too much water would make soupy bricks, so they wouldn't stay. And there was a lot of racks out there, lines and lines of racks, I mean, maybe it's hard to visualize it. And the clay came in on a board, and with that lever, you press down on the lever, and the wire would cut the clay into bricks, the proper size, and they would go on a pallet. And on the pallet, you have special wheelbarrows that you could put seven pallets on. Four pallets on the bottom, and on the top, you could put three more pallets, that makes seven pallets. And the shed, where they make that, I would say it's a shed, was in the, in the center of all the racks that was out there. So when you took off with the, it took one upstairs for shoveling the things in there, one of the Dennis people was running the machine, then you would have two people on the wheelbarrow. Now, interesting enough, when you left the shed to put the, with the wheelbarrow, to put those boards up on the racks, they had racks that you could put them up, but this is, you're going to have to visualize this, of course, I can't show it like this. If you have to go to the furthest end of these racks, in other words, you have to, if you were right here in the middle, you'd have to go to the left all the way down and work your way up, and the next time, you went in the next row and go all the way down and put those up and come back down. Now, the trick of this is that they had to regulate the machine. If you had to go way up down there to start off to put those in, they had to slow down the machine, because by the time you came back, this other guy was just screaming, the shed. They didn't want to stop the machine, so they'd slow it down. But as you came closer and closer, the machine got speeded up. So what happens is you barely got down in the shed, when the other guy was leaving it, and maybe if you were rushing enough, you could sit on the wheelbarrow for a second or two. I really, I really mean a few seconds. By the time he took off, and you wanted to make sure that you want to rush as much as you possibly can, so you could get back to the shed without them having to stop the machine. Because if the other guy had left the shed there, there was nobody there to pick up the brick on the boards. And when you put up those, those boards up on the racks , you had to put them up and set it in straight, because if you tilt them to one side, they would tip over and the brick would fall down, and you couldn 't pick up, it would be too late for that, you'd just leave them there. So you start with the top shelf, and you work your way down, and you rush back, and back and forth , back and forth , and that's the way they did it in those days. And they used to tell us, one (unintelligible word) used to tell us, one, one of them told us, how lucky we were that our wheelbarrows had rubber tires, because in the old days, they're steel wheels on the, on the barrows, so we were so lucky that we were able to wheel with rubber tires. Another time, they told us that during the Depression, and I mentioned that to somebody that worked in the brickyard before me, and I said, I can't believe this, and I told him the story that was told, and he said, yes, that's true. During the Depression, when people were out of work, they told me that people used to come in, in the morning, at the office outside of the brickyard, and wait and hope that somebody would quit, so they could get their job for one dollar a day. One dollar a day, it's sounds, (unintelligible phrase) unbelievable that people, that work was so hard to come by, either in the Depression or '30s, in the early '30s, that kind of thing. Now, the other type of bricks, which people are mostly known about brickyards, and they're called, they're strikers, these people. They work outside. There's a big yard over there, and there's fine sand and it's level, on the ground, and that's water struck, and that is difficult. The people on the hopper, like I was on the wire cut, had the same problem as far as mixing the, the clay and the sand in the hopper. And the people below on each machine, sometimes they had two or three machines, they didn't have that many machines that were there, the people working below, there's two people working below, and they were in swimming trunks, because of the water. They controlled the amount of water, they could tell, you know, and they worked with molds. A mold was just a piece wood , making the size of a brick, with a cross section. And those people were paid by piecework, those were well paying jobs, if you want to make in those days. I don't know how much money they were making, but they were working piecework, and this was money, the good money was. And the faster you worked, the more you make. They start early in the morning before the sun comes up, usually. Like I said, because it was wet work, very wet work, they worked in swimming trunks. What they did is that on that machine, they had a pedal, you pressed down, and I don't know what that pedal did, but, I never worked on the water struck, but you press on the pedal and you had a big handle on the top and you pushed that down, and the mold would come out with six or seven bricks in there. And they'd take that and they'd put it on a, on a wheeler, and I don't recall how many they could put on there, but here again, then they'd run all the way down to the end of the yard. Now, there was nobody controlling the machine, because it wasn't automatic, so there was nobody at the machine. The idea was if you were way down at the end of the aisle, then you 'd take the mold, and you turn it upside down on the ground, flip them over and remove the mold itself, and put in back on the wheelbarrow, and then you go back down. And while you're going down, if you're a good team, you will meet your partner halfway, (unintelligible word). So you went to the machine, but the machine was stopped, obviously, because it was manually operated , you went to the machine, and you did seven, whatever the molds you had, and you came up and you meet the other guy. Now, if one was slower than the other, that didn't work. It, it's, it was teamwork. And the people I remember well, when I was working there, there was a father and son, that used to work in the woods in the winter, and they used to work at Dennis Brickyard during the summer, and that's how they worked together, and boy, they moved , they had to move, they worked well together. Now, a good striker, come to find out, is a person who is short and broad. And those were woodsmen, so they were very capable, strong people. It's a backbreaking job, very much so. So if you 're short and you're wide shouldered, you could do that kind of work. There was an individual over there, I won't mention his name, because he'd be embarrassed . I think they had him over here as a , as a potential striker, I think he gave his name, I know who he is, but I won't mention his name. He wanted to make extra money. He was six feet tall, if not taller, skin, skinny, skinny, skinny like a stick. Not the kind of work for a guy like that, striking. He pestered the owners to be able to strike. They said, no, no, no, no, no. Finally they gave in. Oh, we'll try you, they say. And they put him in the hopper to start off with, obviously they would, like everybody starts out working in the clay, and shoveling that clay, like I said, you got to slice that, that stuff. He worked there, he was doing all right, then they gave him a chance to work down, down below. Oh, I forgot to mention this. Actually, it's a three man team really, because they had to rotate. They did rotate. So the guy in the hopper didn't stay in hopper all the time, all day long. He did it for an hour, maybe, and they'd rotate. It was the right thing to do. So whoever was in the hopper came down, and then wheeled the brick. I heard later on this, this fellow that did that work, I heard that for two weeks after he started working there, he cried like a baby every night when he went home. His back was hurting and his whole body was hurting, but he never quit, he never quit, he stayed . I mean I admire, I had to admire, I had to admire. I see him now and then. He lived in Rumford . As a matter of fact, he's a relative of my wife, I happen to be."
"AL:","That's a great story."
"NB:","That, that, that, that's unbelievable. I was told, for two weeks every night he cried, because his body was very, it wasn't, it wasn't built for this type of work, but he had tenacity. He stuck it out, stuck it out, and then. I think I worked two summers over there. Another interesting part about some people that worked in the brickyard, obviously knows more about it than I do, because I was, I was working just in the morning. My friend , Norm Cote, did more than that. He worked all day long. I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to do that, I didn't want to work all day long. The next interesting thing about working in a brickyard is building a kiln, where they heat up the bricks, that is a very interesting subject. When you build a kiln, they have to decide how big the kiln is going to be, how long, how wide. So people that had the experience, like the Dennis people, obviously they had the experience. You have to build a base, try to be level. You have the surface got, have some sand, some fine sand or rocks and things like that. You had to build that base, and it's like, it's an engineering project, in my opinion, because you have to know what you are doing. You have the foundation itself, and you build it with bricks. You probably cou ld build a foundation with old bricks, it doesn't matter, you know, because there's different qualities in the bricks, as we go along, maybe I'll explain that a little bit. So you build it from bottom up, obviously. And then a kiln has to have so many openings or doors on one side of the kiln. As I recall, it used to be sixteen doors for a big one, so it could be, you know, twelve doors for a smaller one. Sixteen doors on one side and sixteen doors on the other side, these are openings, and that's where you feed the wood to build up the fire and to heat up the kiln. And you build that up, and there's a process of how you, how you structure the bricks in there, it's so many bricks one side, one way, so many bricks the other side, work your way up. And you got to have that up there in your mind, how to do it. I tried it, I was trying to learn, but I, they wouldn't give you a chance to do it, because the bricks are coming up on their conveyor belt, and you had to keep, as you pick up the bricks and put it down to build the kiln, you have to know where to put the bricks right then and there. If you put it on the wrong side, then the belt, and then you change your mind, then the brick coming up on the conveyor would fall down, and you couldn't, they couldn't afford that. If the, if the conveyor stopped, then somebody wou ld say, look, this is what you got to do, there's a pattern to it, you know."
"AL:","Right."
"NB:","Very interesting, very interesting. And as you, not only that, as you built it, you had to try to make sure that all those bricks are level, because if they're not, once you start, they went down, they start choking one way, then the thing is not right up straight. And what they used clay, and they call it mud. A piece of clay, and you take it and put it in your hand, and you roll it, and lift up the brick, and you put it underneath the brick to level it up. So, where you put two bricks at a time, you always work two bricks at a time. You'd pick two bricks, and you'd put it down, and you'd have to put them this way or that way, whichever way. And if you put one down and you saw that the brick was not level, you had to put some clay underneath it to level it up with the other one, because if you start doing that, then the first thing, as you go along it gets worse, obviously. So how fast, it's very intriguing, how fast you have to be able to pick up the piece of clay, roll it, and put it underneath the brick, all, while that belt is moving all the time. There's somebody down there that's putting bricks on the belt, two bricks at a time, two bricks. You got to, you have to move fast, you have to know what you're doing, and it's very intricate how they build that. I, we need, I would appreciate it if you finding somebody that did that and explain that to me again, you know, it doesn't make any difference. I did try it once, it was impossible for me to do it, I mean I couldn't remember which, which way to put them. So you build a kiln, it takes quite a while, you pick thousands of bricks, however many bricks on in the kiln. Then you feed the kiln, feeding the kiln , that's interesting too. You feed it with slabs of wood. Slab of wood comes from trees. If you go to a lumberyard, and they, they cut trees, they cut the bark on four sides of the thing to get the piece of wood out of it. And when you cut the bark, you still have a piece of wood that's underneath the bark, they called it slab. The Dennis' used to go over on Sabattus, someplace Sabattus, and bring up truckloads of that stuff. And you laid it, laid that next to the doors, and sometimes if you pick up a bigger piece of slab, it was a stick, you put those aside. Those are special, when we get to that, I'll explain that. So lay those up, way up there, piled that on each side of those doors, and then they light up underneath, I don't recall how they do that, how they light up the thing, but nevertheless. Now they heat those things for two weeks, twenty four hours a day, all day, all night, during the day, over, for two weeks, we had to keep feeding it. And how they feed that is that approximately every three hours, you had to feed the kiln, put wood in it. Now, that's where those big heavy pieces of slab comes in, they had to have them ready so they could put them. It took three people, one behind the other, to feed the doors. You start on one end, and you had sixteen doors to feed , right? The first person in line, one behind the other, they used to wear the low Army overcoats. Why? Because when you're close to that door, the heat would burn your leg. They didn't have any chaps, or anything like that. They put the big coats, the guys that came back from the service, they had those big overcoats, and they said, well, let's use that, because they're long, they go all the way down. So the first person that got up to that first door had to take two or three pieces of that big heavy ones, throw it in the door, then take a big pole with a pipe at the end of it, a steel pipe, hit the end of that piece they put inside and shove it all the way to the center of that kiln, push it in there. So he put two or three of those, and he put that big pole, shoved that thing in, and sometimes they would go sideways and get stuck. You couldn't stand in front of that door too long, because it was hot, so you had to maneuver it and push it in. Then he went to the next door and did the same thing. The second guy, behind him, used to take a regular slab and shove it in as far as he could in there. There were three, four, five pieces maybe. The third guy had to fill the rest up to the door. And they went on and went on and on, they did sixteen doors like that, and then they'd turnaround, they went on the other side, and they did sixteen doors like that. And then I think it was around every three hours, I'm not too sure about that, they had to feed it, it could be more than that, you know. Then they would ask us if we would want to work overtime at night, and it was quite, oh gosh. And then there was one incident that I recall is that, they had to, after four or five days they were heating it up, they had to go climb on top of the kiln, and with a crowbar, a crowbar or something like that, they had to loosen up the bricks from the top, to let the heat come out. So one of them (unintelligible word) says, you and I are going to go up there and we're going to do this, see. And he says, see those pieces of wood with tracks on down here. He says, you've got to put those on underneath your shoes, because it's so hot on top of the kiln, you can't walk with your, your, your boots, you know. So it was like a handmade type of thing, a two by four with a strap around it. So he puts his on, and he climbs up there, and I put mine on. I'm halfway up the ladder, one of those drops, from I didn't tie them up tight enough. I remember it was the right one. It dropped down, so the obvious thing for me to do was to go down and pick it up and put it back on and climb up. But I didn't think I had the time to do that, and I couldn't go down and waste my time, I don't need up, I go up there, don't need that. As I go up the ladder and I work up there, and this (unintelligible word) Dennis, he's walking and the sparks are coming around underneath the wood. It was burning, it was burning the wood there. (Unintelligible phrase) , by golly. Believe me, I went down and I got mine, believe me, I went up there. And that's how they did that. And when the kiln was already burnt, and then people would buy bricks, and they would tell the quality of the bricks. A certain of the section of the kiln, better quality, different quality."
"AL:","In different sections of the kiln?"
"NB:","Yeah, different sections of the kiln gives you a better looking brick, the face of the brick, was expensive. A certain section of the kiln, the bricks were darker, over-burnt, something like that. Some of them, you have to get rid of them, you couldn 't use them , but they were cheaper, depending on what type you want, the quality of it, that type of thing. When somebody would put in an order for bricks, then it usually was one of the Dennis people, because they're, they're familiar with the quality, it wouldn't be us that would do that. They would go to the particular section of the kiln, and they would, we have like a little chain gang kind of like. They would pick the bricks then, four bricks at a time, always four bricks, two bricks per hand, put them together, toss it to the guy next to you, and he would toss it to the guy in the truck. In most cases, I was the one in the truck, and I would pile them, put them in the truck. The guy that started off picking up the bricks, I think he did the counting, so many bricks (unintelligible phrase) . And the, the obvious thing about this is that there was always a Dennis that started the thing going , picking up the bricks, not only because he knew which bricks to take, but he could go fast. If he went fast, then we have to go fast, the middle guy and the guy in the front has to go fast. If, if it'd be me, I'd probably go slow, and things would go slow, all the way down the line. So that, there was work that, they always made sure, in those days, they really move along, and you had to put the brick, you put the brick. And they had, we had gloves in those days, they had special gloves with two tongues. So one, one side of the is used, you just turn them around . Those special gloves, they were orange too, made of some type of material, cloth, it wasn't leather, and they had two tongues. Another thing that was very interesting is that when they built the kiln and they started at the lower level, we used to toss the brick to them. To be able to take four bricks and toss it way up there, without the bricks separating, was a little skill, you might say. You had to release the brick, not too fast, not too, at the right time, so the bricks would stay together, because the guy on the top, he couldn 't just grab the bricks from all over the place, they had to stay together, and you always worked with four bricks. It takes a little while to learn that, you know, you take four bricks and sometimes it's pretty high, six, seven feet up there, and you toss it to him, and you, and you hope that those bricks stick together so he can grab them, otherwise than that they'd fall down, and they would tell you, give you hell or something like that. So, and Dennis Brickyard, I think, run the Crystal Spring is right in front of that brickyard . They're still there. We had Crystal water over there, it was good , good, cold water, clear water up there, they had over there. So we enjoyed the water, that's one thing for sure. There was rarely enjoyment about the brickyard , but we enjoyed the water and that kind of thing. I don't recall how much they paid in those days, but it wasn't much, that's for sure. The, for myself, the thing that I, I don't know if I'd say enjoy, it's just something I had to do. It's not, it wasn't my livelihood, I was young, I wasn 't married, and I didn't have to do it, I could always go back and go working, I was working at the mill anyway, (unintelligible phrase) . And they had a philosophy, I say philosophy, if you didn't show up, it didn't matter. They didn't, they would never say to you, you didn't show up, oh, you missed a day yesterday, how come, that kind of thing. They didn't bother with it, they just, they, they were able to manage with what they had. They had four brothers, and they had the people working on the, well, the people the yard, I guess they needed to be there, there's no question about that, I'm sure, you know. But there was about three other, four other people, so if the one guy didn't show up, they could manage with what they had. So there was no like you wasn 't scared about losing your job, so to speak, you know, you know what I mean, so. I did that too. I remember another incident also with my friend . They were going to burn a kiln, and him and I was, was going to take our vacation time, we wasn't going to be working. So, we, I think it was one week in the mill that we was going to take vacation (unintelligible word) , and then they asked us to go work overnight. I said, no. I figured me and my friend were going on vacation. They asked my friend. He said, yes. There went the vacation. I said, no, what did you do that for? He said, Norm Cote, well, I can use the money. Yeah, but, I said, you and I was going on vacation, right. Well, that was the way it went. He did another thing like that on me one time. I was working on the third shift, and the, the supervisor asked me if I wanted to work overtime on the second shift, and then I said, no, me and my, my friend, Norm Cote, same guy, we're going roller skating at the Roller Dome. We had, (unintelligible word) , that was already planned, you know. What I didn't realize that the supervisor wanted to see my friend, Norm Cote, asked him if he wanted to work on the second shift overtime. Guess what he said. That night, I went over to his house, and he's not there. So when I went in for work that night, because he was going to continue working on the third shift, because (unintelligible phrase), I said, so what happened, you were not at home. Well, he says, the boss asked me the other day if wanted to, to work, and I told him, yes. He was a good friend , he was a good friend , (unintelligible phrase)."
"AL:","And he liked to work."
"NB:","Oh yeah, he liked to work, that's for sure. And he had, he had this habit of being late most of the time. It didn't bother him. He, he says, Norm, he says, if you were late, it wouldn't bother me. But, I said , you know what, Norm, it bothers me. I said, when I say I'm going to be someplace, I'm going to be there, you know what I mean. But you look at it from a different angle. And he was a good friend , I don't hold it against him, because he was late. If he was late to him, it was all the same. If I be late, it would be all the same for him, that was his attitude. I think I'm going on and on with this, over here about this."
"AL:","Yeah, is there anything else about brick making that we haven't talked about that you think is important to add? Because you really did an excellent job going through all the processes."
"NB:","Yeah, there was a lot, well, like I said, I only worked a summer over there, and I only worked in the morning. They were good people, the Dennis', they were good people. It was hard work, there's no question, and we know that. There's a picture someplace of a Mr. Green, he's holding a few bricks. I've seen that at a bank there someplace, a Mr. Green. I can see he's all raw muscles, so to speak. Oh, well, maybe so, oh, I forgot to mention, see, the people working on the water struck. They start early, before the sun starts coming up, and it gets warm, and they finish early, they finish around one o'clock, maybe two o'clock at the latest, but I say finish , I don't mean finish completely, I mean finish from making the bricks, because they had to go back in the yard . You know all those bricks that they laid down, they had to put a fine sand over it, and they had a contraption that if you had in the mold, let's say there were seven bricks, they had a contraption that they can put that, a piece of metal on, on the top, and pull on it, and it would turn the bricks over, so they could dry up. So their day wasn't quite finished, they had to do that. All the bricks that they laid down, they had to turn them around, so they didn't leave before four o'clock or something. The faster they went, the sooner they could go home, obviously. Yeah, around one o'clock, we, we used to say, oh, boy, they're all done working, they're lucky, they're finished at one o'clock. But no, they had to go back in the yard, and they had to turn all those bricks over to dry them up."
"AL:","Great, thank you very much."
"NB:","Okay, fine , appreciate it."
