"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) November 21 , 2008 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Workers Oral History Project. The date is November 21st, 2008, and we're at Museum L-A, in Lewiston, Maine. This is Andrea L'Hommedieu, and today we're interviewing Real Roy. Real, where and when were you born?"
"RR:","I was born on Dow Avenue in Lewiston, Maine, in 1941 ."
"AL:","On what avenue?"
"RR:","Dow, D-o-w."
"AL:","Okay. In 1941."
"RR:","1941."
"AL:","And is that the area of Lewiston you grew up in?"
"RR:","Yep. I was born there, and I grew up there, I went to school there, and I went to church there, played baseball and the whole, right in the same neighborhood."
"AL:","And Dow Ave. , where is that? It's right in downtown Lewiston , isn't it?"
"RR:","You know where Sabattus Street is?"
"AL:","Yes."
"RR:","You know where Lambert's Market was?"
"AL:","Yes."
"RR:","Well, Lambert's market and Dow Avenue were, Lambert's Market was this way, and Dow went this way. So anybody that wanted to go buy food , went to Lambert's market. We got everything. We got the food there, we got hardware there. We had everything we wanted there. Very nice man to deal with ."
"AL:","And you didn't have to go far. Did your parents have a car at that time, when you were real young?"
"RR:","The first car that I remember my father having was a 1948 Packard . He loved it. But for some reason , the Packard developed some problems and he had to get rid of it. He started looking around for another car, and the finances were not there to pay for the car, so we had to go by bus, or walk to the corner and go by bus. And then, the next car I can remember he had, which was his pride and joy, was a 1965 Chrysler. Loved that car. Family car, we were twelve in the family, we all fit in the same car to go to church."
"AL:","No way."
"RR:","Yeah. We loved it. I learned to drive the car, and by the time I was eighteen, he spotted something that I did to the car, and he told my brother, he says, I think your brothers are ready to earn their drivers license, get their drivers license. And I says, okay. So he called them up one night, he says, would you come over, I'd like to help, I'd like to ask you a few questions. He says, two of the boys are ready to get their drivers license, would you show them how to do it. He says, I'd love it. I says, okay. So I got in, the first thing he told me, watch what I do and listen to what I say, and you 'll never get into an accident. So I did. I had my eyes all, this big . Luckily, today, I've been driving since I was nineteen years old, I've had two accidents that were my fault. Very minor stuff. I love to drive the car."
"AL:","Just like your dad ."
"RR:","Just like my dad. And we used to, every Saturday night, or Sunday afternoon, if we wanted to go out socializing, we had to go say, Dad, can I borrow the car for the evening. And he would tell us, remember the car takes gas, so if you want to go out, make sure you get gas in the car. So I did that two or three times, and then I started getting a little bit, you know, I says, I got wiser, I says, well I'm not going to do this too much more often . So when I reached twenty-one, the legal age to buy a car, I got my own vehicle. So when I bought the vehicle, the car in the driveway, my mother was all shook up. She says, there's a strange car in the driveway. He says, well, let him come in . So I walked in the house, she says, whose car is that. I says, mine. She says, how can you afford that. I says, I'm working, and I just went down the credit union, I made a loan, and the car is mine. Well, she says, now that you have your own car, we won 't be able to have you go out on Sunday drives with us. I says, don't worry about that. If you need a driver Sundays, I'll volunteer. So most Sundays, my car stayed in the driveway. I used to take my father's car. He would love to drive up to Augusta, and then he'd say, you take the wheel. When I got there one day, he says, you take the wheel, I was stunned. I looked at him, I says, what am I supposed to do. Well, he says, you know the signs there that you see. I says, yeah. He says, if I tell you that I want to go up Belfast, he says, look at the signs, Belfast says that way, he say, take off that way. So I did . I started doing that, and one Sunday he took me down to Western Promenade. I was lost. I says, what am I supposed to do. He says, you got a tongue. I says, yeah. Use it. I says, okay. So I went out and I started asking people around. I says, I'm a little lost, I says, I'm looking to go to Lewiston . Oh, he says, you see that road there, that big number one hundred. I says, yeah . He says, take that road , it's going to go to Lewiston. I started picking up from there. I says, look at the signs and you 'll know. Most Sundays I would tell Mom, at nine o'clock in the morning, after we came back from church, I would tell her, bye bye, I'm going for a drive, where, I don't know. I'm going to explore. I came back home once, she says, can we expect you for supper. Supper, at that time, was dinner for today's folks. I says, if I'm not here by four o'clock, forget me, I'm won't be home for supper. So I was in Mechanic Falls at four, and I made it on purpose to go by at four o'clock, stop, eat supper so I could be free , you know, do what I want. So things started that way. And then, we started going around here and there. We started socializing. I went to the Jake Harris Club. We started going to five , six different (unintelligible) groups. There was about, there was a group back in the eighties, we were about eight (unintelligible) in the group."
"AL:","And when you say, we, do you mean shoe workers?"
"RR:","No, just different people. At the age of sixteen, I was working at Hillcrest Poultry, and I wasn't grabbing much money. Money was tight."
"AL:","And , before we go too far, what were your parents' names?"
"RR:","Adelaide and Antonia."
"AL:","Were they from Lewiston?"
"RR:","She is strictly French, but my father was bilingual. When we started going to school, they sent us to Holy Family School on Sabattus Street, and we were taught by nuns. We were taught the bilingual thing. We had to learn both French and English. My mother was telling us, if she would learn to speak French, the way they can do it in Canada, you can go all over the world. I says, okay. So I learned to speak French, in this town here, which is a broken French lingo. It's not polished . So I had a chance to go to Canada. When I got there, I was lost, because the French they spoke there was totally different. So I'd ask myself, what did she say. So she told the woman, oh , she says, he comes from the back woods of Lewiston , which they don't speak French the way we do. So the woman says, okay. So she tried to be good enough to slide her language, so I could understand what she was saying. But finally I picked up the way they were speaking. So when I go to Canada, I speak French . I come back down here, I speak English. And sometimes when I'd be here, I intermix both. People used to laugh at me. I says, okay, so I split both languages, I polished the French, and polished the English , and then when I was in the, like they say, in the English speaking society, I was able to mix in with them quite well. When I went to the French society, I was in with them , the same thing. So I learned to study a lot of stuff. I've studied a little Mexican . I've studied a little Parisian French, which if I'm caught, I could speak Parisian French. And I studied backwoods Yankee, which is a very hard lingo to learn. As I'm going through the world , I'm listening to all this stuff. So finally, at sixteen, my mother says, she asked my brother, she says, would you teach him how to hand sew. Have you seen the hand sewing (unintelligible)? I brought over a little sample for you . This comes from Sebago."
"AL:","And th is is all done by hand ."
"RR:","By hand . You start by here, and then we stitch all the way around here, to here, and all the way through here. Then when you get to this point, you actually punch two holes, one over here, to put two lock stitches there, and they can 't get out."
"AL:","So you did all this by hand."
"RR:","This was done by machine. This was done by hand. And they were fussy."
"AL:","What did you have to know about leather, to be a good hand sewer? Were there things you really needed to be able to feel , or was it already finished by the time you hand sewed it?"
"RR:","The way we got the shoe, it was this here, this is what we called the vamp, the bottom part is the vamp. This is the plug."
"AL:","On the top."
"RR:","On the tip. When we got the shoes, all these things were stacked up about this thick. And these things were all interwoven, this way. So we had to take one of these, and we had to put them in this way, because see, what they call, this is a back stay, and if the back stay is crooked, the whole thing will be crooked. So my brother told me, he says, always set up the shoe by the back stay only. So we took the shoe, put it this way, and make sure, figure, with these two fingers, and then put a tack here, and then go pull the shoe the other way around , and then hold the shoe this way, and then, pliers, and just pull the whole thing, pull this bottom part, all the way up to here. Then we put one tack here, one tack each way here. Sometimes we'd have to put some there, and there. And the tip, we put two tacks here, and two there. And then , what we do, we start with, we set the shoe up on the jack, and you 'd start stitching. All this here, are handmade holes, hand punched holes. They're not pre punched . We had to punch them. The faster you went, the more you made money. The first shoe that I did was my brother's house. I took twenty five minutes to sew. He looked at me, he says, you 'll never make it. He says, you've got to get your hands out of your- . I says, give me a chance. He says, okay, I'll give you a year. I says okay. So I started going in , all of a sudden I jammed a needle under my nail. I let out the biggest holler. Oh, he says, don't worry about that, he says, that's the trade coming in . I says, how many times will I do that. He says, depends on you. So I asked him, I says, okay, what am I going to do next. He says, come here. So we went under the faucet. He says, let it bleed so it will push the blood out. Blood cleans itself, then you put some tincture Merthiolate (sounds like) . It's almost like iodine. But if you put that stuff at night, when it's sore, the next day you don't feel any pain . So I put that in there. I says, oh, that burns. He says, it burns now, but tomorrow, you wait. I says, okay. That was then. So I started the shoes back, and then I says, okay. He says, how you doing . I says, come over here you'll find out. Not too bad, he says. He says, you should give yourself a chance. So when I started at his house, and some nights, I came out of Hillcrest, I was so tired, out of my days work. I almost gave up hand sewing. I had this inner gumption, or whatever they call it, inner strength, go down, go down. So I took the bus, I'd go down to Gene's shoe. They had a building on the corner of Birch and Lisbon."
"AL:","What was it called?"
"RR:","Gene's Shoe. They used to call it Gene's House of Moccasins. Well, the guy had a contract from Eaton Shoe, up in Richmond . He would bring down a car full of shoes, ride down in front of the building , and we'd take all the shoes out. Six pairs goes to you, six pairs goes to you, six pairs goes to you . I always ended up having three pairs, because I was too slow, and I was still learning. Finally, after awhile, I says, well, so Gene tells my brother, he says, well, he's doing good enough . Tell him that the money that he makes will be his. My brother says, no, you tell him. Call him up in the office and tell him. I went over there, I says, anything wrong. He says, you like hand sewing. I says, yeah. He says, well, whatever you do tonight, it's yours. I was tickled pink. I says, (unintelligible) , I says, well, here's what I can do. I can come down after Hillcrest, I can come down and practice here. And if the place is open Saturday mornings, I'll come down Saturday mornings and sew. My mother had always told us, if the foremen asks you to work extra, do it, because that's extra money for your pocket. But she hadn't taught me how to budge yet. Every time I'd have shoes, a band we formed , a group called , Jay Carters (sounds like), we used to meet at different places for drinks and all that, nights. What I did, I left, I had gone in at Billings Shoe, for the time being. That was my first full time job, which was in the Continental Mill. I says, okay, I finished that at three, I cross over and go in Gene's Shoe and I'd say, can I have a case. Take this one. So I put the leather in the water, which we had to do, because if the leather is not in the water, it's just as stiff as this. You can't bend it. So when the leather was in the water, you 'd pull it out of there, it was dripping wet, that's about time, that's when you could maneuver it. So I'd last up twelve pairs of shoes, I'd go eat supper, after that I'd come back, I'd sew till eight o'clock at night, I'd cross the street, go see my friends , we'd have a few drinks, and the next day I ~ack at work at six, until two o'clock in the afternoon . And then I says, well, this is not enough . I got laid off from Billings Shoe, so I went down to Sebago, which these were being made. An entirely different process, believe me. So I had to learn the whole process over again , which I did. I picked it up. We were traveling with car pools at the time. I didn't care to travel with a car pool, but I just didn't say a word. I said, some day I'm going to make a change. So after twelve years, a friend of mine calls me up at home, he says, I hear you're on CB. I says, yeah . How do you like it. I says, I like it. He says, okay. It ended there. I still kept working at that job. When I'd go home at night, a guy says hey, there's a car sitting in front of your house. So one night I came to say, one word, and I was told, shut up. I didn't know what was going on. So I got home, guy calls me up, he says, you were told to shut up. I says, how do you know. He says, you 're being investigated. I says, for what. He says, you're going to have a radio job. I says, where. He says, Public Works, a desk job. I said , you're crazy, you're kidding . He says, no. So I went there for the interview. I went there on Wednesday. Guy says, well, you 'll have to go for a physical to see how much stamina you got. I says, okay. So I went to Dr. (unintelligible), he says, you sure you want that thing. I says, yes, I'm on radio , and I'm on third shift, so there won 't be too, too much hassle to it. He says, okay. He signs the paper. So I got over there, the guys says, you ready to work. I says, now. He says, yep, you didn't work yesterday, so you 're going to make up for yesterday, you 're going to make up today, and then you 're on the job. I'm going to show you how to do it. All through this time, I had started juggling the budget, like they say, and I was watching. I says, great, I went from forty-four dollars at Hillcrest Poultry, to one hundred and fifty-eight dollars at Billings Shoe, dropped back down to eighty-five in Westbrook because I wasn 't too, too familiar with this pattern . Going back home, I was going back up to a hundred fifty, and doing pretty good. So I says, by doing this, and my part time job, I'm going to hit the two hundred . So finally, the day that I had my, I was fully initiated, I went up to the foreman , I says, I got some bad news for you. He says, what. I says, I'm all done. He says, why. Well, I said , I've been interviewed for a radio job at home and I'm going to grab it. There's no traveling. He says, a radio job. I says, yeah. He says, where. At Public Works. He says, there 's a lot of (unintelligible) there. I said , well I've got a chance to take it, and I'm taking it. He says, give me your slip and your time card . He gives me a check. I got home, nothing to do but sit in the chair and listen to the police department calls. After awhile it got so, winter started setting in , and I couldn't take the stress of the winter stuff. I says, well, I'm gonna have to do something else. So instead of going back to (unintelligible) , which I hated now, I said, I'm going to go back to Billings. So I went back to Billings. The foreman says, what do you want. I says, well, I'd like to have a job. How many years you been sewing. I says, seventeen. Come on it. As time went by, I changed jobs about seven times, but the money kept going in, going in , going in , going in . My brother, Morris, by that time, had passed away."
"AL:","Now, this is the brother that taught you how to hand sew."
"RR:","That taught me how to do it. He had taught me, in hand sewing there are no short cuts. Don't think there are. I says, okay. When I worked at Billings, I saw plenty of short cuts. I says, uh-oh, somebody's gonna get in some trouble. But one coworker said, do it this way. No, I says, my brother Morris showed me how to do it. He's never lost a job. He's never been fired . He's always produced good shoes. I'm going to do it the same way he did . So I stuck to my guns. I looked at one guy, one day, I says, you know something, within six months, we're going to be outside looking in. He says, what. I said, the work is lousy over here. They're producing lousy work. He gave me an insult. He says, who the hell cares, as long as the money's there. I says, yeah, the money's here now, but when you lose the job the money will be gone, won 't it. Where will you go. In the meantime a good friend of mine, Larry Daigle, very nice man, he saw me working, I was having a hard time for it. He come by my desk one day, he says, stop working. I says, why. I'm tired of seeing you work so hard. I says, okay, what are you going to do. So he looks at my bench, there was a stack of (unintelligible), about this thick, he says, what are these. I says, they're good for the dump. He says, no, no, no, no, he says, you 're going to start with that, you 're going to make money. I says really, how. Give them to me and I'll fix them. I says, okay. After lunch he came by, he had them all fixed up. He took his lunch hour to fix it up. I was very, very thankful for what he done. He says, are you willing to lose half an hour's time this afternoon to learn a new trick. I says, anything to make money. He says, okay. First of all, he says, when you start in the morning, start by the right foot, not by the left. Remember that tomorrow, right foots first. Then he says, take this awl, instead of pushing through the hand this way, put the awl in your wrist, and just push your wrist this way. I started doing that at one o'clock in the afternoon, at three o'clock I looked at him , hey Larry. He says, what. I says, he says, how much you do. I says, come over here. I had gained eight pairs an hour."
"AL:","No way. That's a lot."
"RR:","A lot. Then he says, you're doing good. I was doing great. Then jealousy set in. The office thought I was stealing tags from the box to add numbers to my book. So the foreman comes up, he says, where's your tags for the past three days. I says, they're right there. He takes the tags, he goes to the office, he comes by. I says, there a problem . No. I says, I know the problem. You thought I was stealing tags. He says, what do you mean. I says, you think I'm blind. I can see when things are going on . Well, he says, you were going much faster than before. I says, that's thanks to Larry Daigle, showed me a new trick, I was able to go faster. Three weeks after I started that system , the whole job goes dead . I was at my best, I was throwing them out. I says well, if I do a better job I'll be able to keep my job. So when the foreman came up to me , he says, you 're out, get out of here, pick up your tools. The only thing I thought of doing, I says well, I took my glasses off, took the towel, and I just let it go. Like they say, I'll throw in the towel. He said , you 're finally throwing in the towel. I says, at this one. Somebody says, well they're starting up a pre punch hand sewing line at Stride Right. I says, it's worth a try. I go over there, oh my gosh , another puzzle."
"AL:","A new system to learn."
"RR:","A new system to learn. The holes that match. One morning I was trying to match the collar, this here is a collar. With the pre punch, they usually put the plug right there, and every hole matches. You don't have to (unintelligible). This one, there was two holes missing. I called the girl, I says, is there anything wrong with your people over there. She says, what. I says, this particular style has two holes missing. Where did they put them. Well, she says, they're doing their best. So I got an idea , oh , I'll bet you I know where it is. So I take my knife, cut from here to there, put it out there, there's the two holes underneath. I called her up, I says, I found it. She says, can you stitch it. I says, no, but by doing that, the factory is going to close in six weeks. So I did some good shoes. I was working part time at night doing all types of shoes, and every time I'd see that mess, I'd say, oh my gosh , that job is going down . So the third day I brought my work in there, they said, we're sorry, but we're closing up the hand sewing shop. I say, I knew it was going to. So that was the end of my shoe history."
"AL:","What did you do later on, after shoes?"
"RR:","The doctor, when I turned forty-four, there was nothing else to do. I had a nervous breakdown , because I had lost what I loved to do. So I went to welfare. I was living in a different room. I was no longer living at home, so I said , well I got to get some money for rent and food and all that. So I went to welfare. I used to, every Wednesday, I'd cry my head off. Cry, cry. What is your problem . I says, I need help. She says, you are getting help. I says, this will not be forever. I'm looking for a long term solution. Well, she says, what we'll do, she says, we're going to send you to our doctor to be examined. So I went there. Dr. John Young, I think, in Auburn. I came back, he sent the paper, he says, he's a sick guy, he needs a job. So they said , okay, we're going to send him to a psychiatrist through Tri-County. I went there, they examined me. Perfectly fine, and he needs a job."
"AL:","He needs a job."
"RR:","Anyway, the third run , I went back down there, I went back down to welfare. The women told me, you know what you should do. I says, what. She says, why don't you go to Social Security. I says, I'm too young. I'm only forty four. She says, if you can prove you're sick you 'll get it. So I went to social security, filled out all the papers, they asked me what I had. I says, I was working construction, I fell on top of my head and I've been having headaches from then on, migraine head aches. They're blinding stuff, I can't see half the time. Where did you go seek help. I says, I went to Dr. (unintelligible) for help, I went to see Dr. Rita for help. I have scoliosis, I have everything wrong. She says, okay. So when all the papers came in, the woman looks at that, man, she says, you got a stack of papers there a mile thick, and they're all in favor of you staying home. Well, I says, what else are you going to do. We would like you to go see your mother. Ask her what condition you were when you were born. She was already eighty' eight. I says, I better get myself together. So I went back there, and I sat on the swing and we started talking. She says, how are things going. I says, mom, they're going lousy. I need your help. She says, anything. I says, I've got to stop working. She says, stop. I says, not that easy. I just went to Social Security and they wanted to know what condition I was when I was born. Two big tears come down. I says, what happened. She says, when you were born, you were a blue baby, you weighed a pound and a half."
"AL:","Tiny, tiny."
"RR:","I says, okay, anything else. She says, isn't that enough . I almost told her, why didn't you let me die. I went to Social Security and I told her, well, you can call her up. She called up my mother. She says, I want to speak to the woman that brought him in the world . I says, you realize she doesn't understand English. She says, I understand French . She says, what happened to him . She told them . That was it. Now I've picked up hobbies. The doctor at Social Security told me, Mr. Roy, now that you are retired, don't stay in bed. I says, what am I gonna do. Get up, do the same thing that you were doing when you went to work. Don't bring your lunch bucket, don't bring your tool chest. I says, what am I gonna do. He says, go for a walk around the city, at least a mile. Then pick up a hobby, making puzzles, bike riding, do this, he says, don't worry about the money, you'll have a full paycheck coming in. And if you need help in planning, we 'll do it for you . So I bought a bike. Every morning I'd take off in a different direction . And when it got to a point where I was fed up with the bike. I says, well, I should do something else. Somebody met me in the store, they said, hey, what are you doing for excitement. Nothing, I put my bike away. He says, why don't you buy yourself a cam corder and visit places, take pictures of places. I says, that's an idea. It caught on. I got the cam corder and I started, if there's a house being built, you know that big hotel in Auburn, I got that on film . I got the St. Mary's emergency room on film . I got the other building on Gracelawn on film . And when I hear something else is being built, I go over there, I film it. And one day I was on , you know when they put up the bridge on Main Street, the Veterans Bridge. I was there, looking around, visualizing that. One morning I was there, and who did I see, the Sun-Journal man. I said, hi, how are you. He says, fine. He says, what are you doing . I said , I've got a hobby, and I'm taking pictures of th is construction and all that. He says, do you mind if I follow you around. I says, what for. He says, you 're a hobbyist, ain't you. I says, yeah . He says, I take anything that moves. You're retired . I says, yeah . He says, you 're taking pictures of this. I says, yeah . He says, do your thing, and let me do mine. I says okay. So I started walking around , they were laying pipe there, so I went there and I was watching them laying pipe. All of a sudden, I got up the next morning, I look in the paper, I says, oh no. Front page (unintelligible). I laughed . I called up the guy, I says, you sneak. Well, he says, now I'm getting to know you, GAN is getting to know you, CSH knows you, Channel 8 knows you . And he says, when they see you someplace, you're going to be it, and you 're going to be a hit. I says, I got noth ing to lose. I'm still doing it."
"AL:","That's wonderful."
"RR:","But now (unintelligible) I've to this awful scoliosis business. I've got arthritic business. It's terrible."
"AL:","What did your dad do for work?"
"RR:","He was a carpenter. He built, he took the house that, well , when they started they used to live on Bartlett Street, and they wanted to get out of there. So they went out on Bell Avenue, the same place I told you I was born. He took a house that was about the size of this room and he added on to it. He was a finish carpenter. When my mother told him, we have another one coming, he'd look around to see where he could put another room. So, one there, one there, one there and the house got big. There was twelve of us, so we had a big kitchen downstairs, they had a big living room , they had two bedrooms, and they had the kitchen, cooking kitchen and the heating kitchen in the back. It didn't seem to do any good. It heated a quarter of the house. He says, I got to do something. So what he did, he went upstairs. He opened up a second floor, adding more rooms, add this one, add that one, add that one. By the time he was done he had a bathroom upstairs, he had a big middle hallway. He had three, four bedrooms. We all slept upstairs. I was thinking, if I would have known this, I would have brought my cam corder and I wou ld have showed you what the house looked like. It's all on DVDs and cassettes. Somebody mentioned to me the other day, why don't you have your cassettes turned into DVDs, because I've got a huge DVD set that I bought. So I called the person who made them. Ten bucks an hour. I says, no thank you . If a tape is two and a half hours long, that's a lot of money involved. I've got a hundred twenty five tapes. So I says no, I'll leave them this way. The guy from the Sun Journal was doing, after he did that, he says do you mind if I go to your place for an interview. I says no. So he came up to my place and he says, you sit in your chair and you work on your tapes, and I'll interview you. I was doing that, this one goes there, that one goes there. Man, did he do a job."
"AL:","That's really neat. And you were one of twelve children."
"RR:","One of twelve."
"AL:","And you must have been one of the youngest."
"RR:","Third youngest."
"AL:","That's a big family ."
"RR:","My father died at the age of eighty-three, and mom died at the age of eighty-nine."
"AL:","They lived long lives. Is there anything else that you want to add , that I haven't asked you?"
"RR:","Like what?"
"AL:","Anything. Relating to shoes, or your family. Before we end today, I just want to give you a chance to fill in something that I didn't think to ask."
"RR:","Well like I said, I come from twelve and I'm third youngest, so there's two of them departed, and the two departed were hand sewers. Morris was a hand sewer, and Roger was a hand sewer. They never had a shoe back that was done wrong, never. I remember when I was at Billings, I had done a shoe, and it didn't come out too good. The foreman looked at me, and I says, oh no, what did I do now, I says, what's wrong. He says, this thing is crooked. Look at it, it's a little too high. So Larry Daigle then came by, he says, what's wrong with the shoe. I said I don't know, it's crooked . He says, that's nothing. He says throw it back in the water. When it was wet, he says, I'll show you something, he says, if it's this way, put it in the water, but it back on your jack, and just take a tack puller with the two prongs this way, just take it that way, just pull, and it's going to pull the leather right back where it belongs."
"AL:","Well, thank you so much."
"RR:","You 're quite welcome."
