"(lnterviewer(s):","Rachel Desgrosseilliers, Roger Nadeau) Rachel Desgrosseilliers: Rockland , at the Island Institute today. We're interviewing Ted for the shoe workers in the industry. This is part of the oral history project. We are interviewing Ted on November 27th. I'm Rachel Desgrosseilliers, who will be doing the interviewing, along with Roger Nadeau, who used to work for Ted at Falcon Shoe. Ted, could you start by stating your full name and spelling it, so we have it correct to the -. Ted Johanson: Do you mean the official Theodore, you mean that, Theodore Courtland Johanson?"
"RD:","Exactly the way you are, or how-."
"TJ:","Okay, T-H-E-0-0-0-R-E, Courtland , C-0-U-R-T-L-A-N-0, Johanson, J-0-H-A-N- S-0-N ."
"RD:","Good, where were you born?"
"TJ:","I was born in Lynn , Massachusetts. Lynn was actually a shoe town, and that's how I got in the business."
"RD:","Oh, okay, good, that's interesting. And when did you decide to move to Lewiston? 1"
"TJ:","That was, we started in 1963 was, I think, when the factory started , and I had got out of college. I was an engineer, a graduate engineer, and went to work for a shoe factory, which was my family's business back in Massachusetts. I had done a study for them, and it was obvious that they weren't going to survive in Massachusetts, in my mind, and so, I had done a study for them of places that they could move their factory. I came up with three places, and they turned them all down, and then it finally dawned on me that my father and his two brothers, who basically owned the business, they didn't want to leave Massachusetts, and they were, at that time, they were sixty years old and why should they leave. So I realized that if I was, for the bus-, if I stayed there, that business was going down, and so I looked to set up a factory of my own. I had one of the brothers, which was the president of the company, my uncle, he said , he said, I'll get five investors together, we'll put up five thousand dollars and you can go build your factory, and I didn't have a nickel. And, so then in my travels of looking at a place for them, I had found Lewiston-Auburn, which was not one I had offered them, because they had capital and could set up a factory somewhere else, so we had looked at other, other communities, but I knew of Lewiston-Auburn. And there was, one there was high unemployment, there was like eleven percent. There were high unemployment among skilled shoe workers, which was important in my mind, and there were empty buildings because the, the textiles were leaving, and so there was tons of space that could be rented for pretty much nothing. There was an infrastructure there for the shoe industry in Lewiston-Auburn . United Shoe Machinery had an office there. They kept supplies there. There were all kinds of shoe suppliers in that area, so it was a perfect place for somebody who didn't have a gosh darn nickel to get started. And so, that was the place I figured would be the best, you know, for me."
"RD:","What was the community like, when you first established in Lewiston-Auburn? 2"
"TJ:","There was, there, it was, it was definitely I would say the Franco-American heritage was still strong, very strong, because I can remember one of the things, I ended up, if I can remember right, and when I, I first lived in there, I lived in a motel called The Masonette, which was downtown-."
"RD:","Bless you."
"TJ:","Yeah okay, but that was, got to be, (unintelligible phrase), to my date, I ended up, I ended up living at the YMCA over in Auburn, because it was, I think, nine bucks a week or something like that, so that's where I ended up living for the first six months. But anyway, I mean it was interesting to me that, that downtown, you know, still you saw teenagers talking French to each other. That indicated to me that heritage was strong, and that it was, it was still there. And I would have to say in the time that we were there, and the factory was there, you lost that. You know, we really lost that, we lost that heritage. But there was, that was the, the main and downtown, you know, that was, was, was really the center of that, that French culture, it really was. And I, I loved it, it was, it was, it was terrific. But anyway, that was the, the major difference, and the other th ing was, there was unemployment, tremendous unemployment in Lewiston at that time, it was ten or eleven percent, and that was really the best decision we ever made. I mean because the people really did want to work. You know, that was the one thing that Lewiston-Auburn had."
"RD:","And the French culture are hardworking?"
"TJ:","Yeah, absolutely, yeah, absolutely, yeah , it was really great. That we had, we, we even had tryouts for our job when we started . You know, I mean , with that many unemployed people that you could put in tryouts for, for, for very specific trades, like a bed laster. We're having bed laster tryouts at, at ten o'clock, and 3 you might have five or six people come in and tryout to be a bed laster."
"RN:","And then that's how you, you opened up. I know that was in '63, and I didn't think, get there until '69 myself. But I, I didn't, we -."
"TJ:","The thing was, I had some ideas and they were unique for the shoe industry, and basically one was kind of a conveyor operation. And when people would come in to tryout, there were always people who didn't like change, and people would say, oh that will never work. I'd say, okay, next, because you had four or five people to choose from , and there was no sense choosing somebody who didn't have faith that what you had was going to even, was not going to give it a try, if you know what I'm saying. And it was only (unintelligible word) even possible because it was system (unintelligible phrase) point, it really was. I mean those people really wanted to work."
"RD:","So, when you started, what was some of the major challenges that you faced , if it was easy to get the workers?"
"TJ:","Well, of course, you know, the, the, the big challenge, of course, you got to get the customers, okay. I had an old salesman, that I had, in the old days he had worked for my father and uncles, and then he had broken off and set up his own company with five other partners back in Pennsylvania, or something. But they were a typical, I'd call it a Brooklyn partnership, you know, in that one would leave everyday and a new partner would come in everyday and they were always fighting and all this kind of a, and finally Aaron, his name was Aaron Petashnak, and Aaron finally left them. And I think they went broke, if I'm not mistaken, I don't know. And so, Aaron, I teamed up with Aaron, he was my salesman, when I started , and you know, getting the customers was very important, you're brand new, who is going to give you the business. And we were lucky, I mean, to be 4 honest with you. He had the stature to get the first orders from people, but then the product had to speak for itself, and we really worked hard to make a very quality product, and , and the people liked the product, and we went from there. But Aaron got, you needed an Aaron to get us in the door of those customers, and then once we were in the door, the product, you know, was, was good and was inexpensive. Our, our process was always, our philosophy was always to have the most modern techniques that we can use because I start-, I started with the fellow, Bruce Hanley, who was my vice president of manufacturing , and we were both engineers, and so we saw the shoe industry for what it was. You have an awful lot of handwork, and technology was just coming into the, into the shoe industry, and of course, it was, you know, most people, they really don't like change, and so it's very difficult to bring new technology into anything, and that was Bruce and l's forte, was to bring technology into that, into the industry, and therefore our costs were a lot lower than anybody else's and , and we grew pretty rapidly, which is a-."
"RD:","Your, your, well your workforce, can you speak a little bit about them? You mentioned something about a lot, it was easy to get into the, you know, as far as, you didn't need an education, and so forth. Did you have a, was it a good workforce? Did you have to -?"
"TJ:","Yeah, one of the things about the shoe industry is that the jobs are, they're, they're skilled jobs, and it, it takes a, in many cases, it takes a long time to really learn the jobs and run the machinery, and learn how to do it right. One of the things that I think that we've had people from other industries, who come and view the factory , and what they always never really understood but when they, until they saw it, was that when you're working with shoes, basically you're working on a natural product, which is leather. And leather is nothing more than the hide of an animal, which is just like our skin, and every part of that leather is 5 different. It, it stretches differently one way from another, whether it, and it's softer if it comes from your belly. Do you want shoes made out of my belly or do you want them made out of my back? You want them made out of my back, because it's firmer, you know. And so the leather, whether it's from out of the armpit of the animal, or the stomach of the animal, or even the back, certain parts of it, it's all different. Well, well, when you making, using that product, then each piece that you're working with is different, and to automate that, that's the reason why it was one of the last industries that was ever automated was, wow, this stuff is tough to work with. And so, that's what took the skill and the time, was that, you know, over time you would slowly work with different materials and know how to handle them, and, and, and solve those, those problems as you're working with it. So that's why it wasn't a rote job of, of learning something, you know, it really took experience. That was the thing , it took experience. And , and so that's what a lot of those people had, and because the industry was basically a piecework industry, which means that they get paid by each piece they did, that there were certain people, who not only had the experience and had the skill, but then had the speed , and those people did quite well. I mean, that was the problem, was some of our supervisors, was making sure that our supervisors had greater salaries than the people who worked for them, because some of those people really could make some money. If you remember that, those days, (unintelligible word). So, I, I think that was it, and (unintelligible word) , yeah, as far as the, and so it wasn't the education, it was the experience that counted . Later on, as we progressed, and as the industry changed , then all of a sudden education now started to be important. Because what happened was, we started to use technology and computers, and our machinery got more complex, and the people, who had to run them, had to know more, and as the, well, the thing that happened was we would make a particular shoe, and in the old age, you might make twenty thousand pair of this particular shoe. Well, everybody knew how to 6 make that shoe, because you made twenty thousand pair of them, you made them all the time. And as foreign competition came in, and the large orders went overseas, and we were left with the smaller and smaller volumes of how to make these things, so therefore, they didn't have many, many pairs to work with, you had very few pairs. And so, we had to actually make a construction sheet, and they're, as far as steps in making, especially the more complex boots we ended up, there, there could be a hundred, over a hundred different steps in making that product. And they might be different hundred from another shoe or another one, and they might be, some operations might not performed on one, but they are on another, they might be in a different sequence. All of that had to be all explained . So, all of the sudden now, you had people who now have to be able to, to read English , they have to be able to read well, they have to be able to understand, how all those jobs are run by computers, they had to be able to operate computers. So all of a sudden, it changed, and we found that we ended up giving them their education. Roger was a big part of that, in starting that process of, of getting people to go back to school and getting their, their high school diplomas and moving on with other subjects and other courses. I, I think we, were we the first, Roger, to do -?"
"RN:","To do an onsite. It was Geiger Brothers that had done that with their employees, continued education, you know, education program in the work place. And so we hired , we did hire, we contracted with Lewiston Adult Education , and they came in, in house to do the classes, so the employees who wanted to participate, to upgrade, to go for their GED, basically, and that worked well for us. T J: Yeah, yeah , it really, it really worked well."
"RD:","Can you comment, you had started at the beginning , you mentioned something about that you were trying to figure out why the Rumford kids and the dropout rates, and all that, can you comment on that? 7"
"TJ:","It goes back, it goes back to that, you see, the, that, that education portion, in that, it's fun- , we did have a group of teachers who came in. At that time, I think the superintendent in Lewiston wanted some of the teachers to see the jobs in, in the city, so they could understand where these children that they were teaching were going to end up, and we had a great discussion about education. And they were concerned about in Lewiston they, they had a high dropout rate, and we talked about the difference between Lewiston and say, Rumford , because they both had the, the French heritage and, and the same (unintelligible word), the same, the same people immigrated from Canada to, to Rumford as to Lewiston , why, why this difference. And I guess at the time, we felt that the mills in Rumford , the paper mills, they just plain required a, a high school diploma, they, you would need to be considered for a job, and those were the good jobs in Rumford, so every kid at the high school knew he had to have a diploma in order to get that job, so that was why he stayed . And it was different with us, because unfortunately, because of piecework and the skills and some of the experience, people could be in the industry and they could end up making very good money. Well if your parents made good money and they didn't have a high school education, you know, all of a sudden you're getting pretty itchy at sixteen and seventeen years old and want the money, you know, what the devil , you know, they're doing it, why can't I? And so I really think that was one of the unfortunate things about Lewiston-Auburn, and I unfortunately think about both the textile industry and the, the shoe industry was that you could get there, through experience, end up making money and raise your family and all that, no problem , but I don't think that it, it set, set the right message to the kids. But I, I, I feel strongly about that."
"RD:","Do you think that is still happening somewhat today, where kids can get on a job with the high salaries? 8"
"TJ:","You know, I don't know, I, I, you know, because I'm not in, in tune with that. I do know that later on, when we ended up really taking over a, starting a mold company, where we ended up with machinists and mold makers and all that kind of (unintelligible word) , as part of our (unintelligible word) , kind of a separate company, but we owned it, and then finally the fellows who ran it, we let them take it over, but the problem with that company was trying to get kids in high school to want to go on and take, take machinist courses and things like that, and those were good jobs, they were good paying jobs. But even at that time, and that was in the later years of, of our factory, boy it was tough to get those kids to go do that, you know, at that particular time. They, they just didn't seem to have the, you know, see the vision out there, two years or three years from now, you know."
"RD:","Were most of your workers French Canadian?"
"TJ:","Oh yeah."
"RD:","Or did you -? So most of them were."
"TJ:","Yeah, most, oh yeah, most were French Canadian, yeah, absolutely."
"RD:","Because like in the textiles -."
"TJ:","As I say, fifty percent, yeah , fifty percent of them, I, I don't know, as I say, I, I, well over fifty percent of the kids at the time, I think spoke French, easy, you know. As I say, that, that, over time, over the thirty, thirty five years that we were there, I saw that decrease, you know, you didn't see the teenagers being able to speak French anymore. But when we started, the teenagers were able to speak French and they did . You'd see two teenagers on the street, and you'd see them 9 speaking French to each other."
"RD:","Did you find that as the years went by, that different, other ethnic groups would come in, so that it changed the composition of your work staff, or?"
"TJ:","I, I, I don't think, at that time we, we didn't have any one big group come in, such as what's happened in Lewiston-Auburn lately, but I don't think it was any one, one ethnic group that came in after that, it was more a mixed American group, I'd have to say, or-."
"RD:","So, they all pretty much -."
"TJ:","Second or third generations by that time, and who knows what we have."
"RD:","So, there was no major conflict between the workers and so forth, as far as it was a good workforce?"
"TJ:","No, I don't think so, yeah, no, no, not at all."
"RD:","Did you find that your workers worked their day and then went home and did their thing, or did they tend to socialize as friends outside of the, or do you have any idea?"
"TJ:","You know, you know, I really don't know about that. They, as to whether they had the same groups outside the factory that they had inside the factory, I don't know. They had their groups inside the factory, that's for darn sure."
"RD:","Okay, what do you mean by, what do you mean by that?"
"TJ:","Weill mean, there were people who would always kind of, they'd always have 10 lunch together, or you know, in those days, Rachel, of course, you know, we still had smoking , and you know, you'd allowed smoking back in those days. So, you know, there would be a group that would always go out to the smoking room together, you know, well maybe it was the smokers, I don't know, but, but, but remember we would have smoking rooms, remember that, Roger? You know, yeah."
"RN:","Yeah."
"TJ:","Yeah, and, and they would go and then the other people at lunch breaks would kind of find their little groups, and, and you could always see the same people together, you know, in, in those days."
"RD:","Which is almost natural."
"TJ:","Yeah , which is natural, right, absolutely, yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah."
"RD:","How did they get to, to a, to get their jobs? Like it seems like I went with Roger, and there were so many, which amazed me, so many steps to making a shoe."
"TJ:","Right, that's, yeah."
"RD:","I said I guess I'll never complain about buying a shoe again, but how did they come to, to get the jobs that they got?"
"TJ:","At the very beginning, as I said, we, we, we had people and we had tryouts for the jobs. I mean because that, those skills already existed and then after that, of course, then we had to just, we had to bring them along and train them -. 11"
"RD:","So you had to have special training?"
"TJ:","Ourselves, and, and, and that was, it was difficult. It means you had to have, you know, an extra machine to be able to train that person on, but in, in our case, we had it, I mean because, because we had started with a different concept, which was kind of a conveyor line. You can 't stop the line. If you've got a machine that goes down , you're in deep trouble. So we had probably more spare machinery than was truly present in the shoe industry as an average at that particularly time. Well now, having that extra machine, also allowed you the opportunity to train somebody. So it was kind of a back way thing that allowed us to do some training that maybe the other factories weren't able to do, you know, at that time. But we had to have it for a different reason , and now once it's there, you know, an extra fifty thousand dollars for a piece of machinery. Those machines were expensive, all those little machines you saw there, if you've been through the factory, they're not cheap. And one of the things you have to understand about the shoe industry back in the early years, okay, United Shoe Machinery was declared a monopoly in, I think, nineteen fifty, and I ended up actually, I ended up doing a study of, of this United Shoe case, because they were declared a monopoly. Prior to that, what they did, was they would only rent machinery, they would not sell it. And when they rented it, they also rented it with maintenance, so you did have to pay for the parts, but the maintenance was free. So therefore, anybody could start a shoe factory, not anybody, but anybody could financially, you didn't have to have the capital, because all this machinery, you could rent. Not only could you rent it, but it didn't make any difference how big you were, it, because there, there wasn't any economy of scale of being able to buy the equipment and end up with a, with a, a, shall we say an advantage, an economic advantage, over somebody who was only renting . Okay? So that even though United Shoe created a monopoly in the 12 shoe machinery industry by doing that, it, it created competition in the shoe industry, and what it was, was United Shoe was declared a monopoly in the early or mid fifty, I think maybe fifty five or, fifty five , fifty six. So that's what changed in the shoe industry, which was United Shoe was declared a monopoly, and now they had to sell the machinery. Now what that changed was that if they had a particular piece of equipment that did the job and they're charging rent for it, why should they go out and invent a new machine that will do that better and faster, because all they're going to do is replace their own machines. So once they were declared a monopoly, all of a sudden new machines started to be developed for the shoe industry. Not only United Shoe Machinery, but other machine companies, International, all those, started to come with, because now people would, now they had an opportunity to sell their, their machines, okay, into the industry, okay. That's what was happening, just happened , as I got into the industry, and Bruce and I came as engineers. That's when why I say we were bringing technology, the industry had not seen many new machines in all those years, okay."
"RD:","So that was an open door for you?"
"TJ:","So it was an open for us, and we did, and we stepped into that, and we'd bought all the new techn-, we, we, we had all of the new technological machines. We built, we forged a relationship with United Shoe Machinery, and when they had to test a machine, they sent it up. Do you remember we had some rooms?"
"RN:","Yes."
"TJ:","We set, we set up a special room that nobody could go in, we just kind of pushed the shoes in, there would be one person they trained to run th is new machine, and they were testing out the machines. And we would test out the machine for 13 them, and it would be completely secret, and all that, and it would be only the few employees who were in there working on that machine would know anything about it. They'd come out, cut the shoes, go in and perform whatever and go out, but there was, there was testing that machinery. But all that was just taking place, you see, in the, in the, in the late fifties and the early sixties, as we started , there was this big change toward new inventions in the shoe industry, which there had not been."
"RN:","You were probably one of the new people on the block."
"TJ:","Right, yeah, absolutely, and so that was, that's what happened, yeah , yeah."
"RD:","So when you , so when you started, was there a lot of competition in Lewiston- Auburn, as far as other shoe shops?"
"TJ:","Yeah there were a lot, there, there were quite a few shoe shops, as a matter of fact, and -."
"RD:","And that didn't bother you?"
"TJ:","Well, it bothered me, I was just a little, you know, I, I was twenty six-."
"RD:","You didn't know any better?"
"TJ:","I was twenty six years old, you know, and they didn't want to talk to me for all the tea in China, but they had a local shoe union at the time, and it w-, it was, it had to be a joke on both sides, it really, I, I really th ink I, it probably was. In that they would, I guess they'd negotiate the rates , but the shoe union had a hard, I guess they had an attorney and they, and those factories had, had an attorney, and the 14 two lawyers would get together and decide what the gosh darn increase was going to be. I was amazed, I mean I went in there, I sat in the meeting, we didn't, we weren't a part of that, but I, you know, I wanted to know what was going on , so I went to the, the employees, the employers meeting with, our employees weren't involved in the union. And their lawyer was telling them what the, what the, what the deal was going to be, and I, I sat there saying this is crazy, you know, it's not the, you know, gee what should we do, and all, no, the lawyer came and told them what they were going, what they were going to give. He'd already talked to the other lawyer."
"RD:","And it was all set."
"TJ:","It was all set, was set up by the two lawyers. I, I, and I said, boy, this is, this is crazy, but that's the way it was."
"RD:","Did your company ever have a union?"
"TJ:","No we did not, no we did not."
"RD:","Did they try to unionize, or did you?"
"TJ:","You know, I think they did (unintelligible word). What happened was, as my parents' factory in Massachusetts started to go down, they made men shoes and we only made boys' shoes at that time. They, handsewns became big, and so we started for them a small handsewn factory for them, that we oversaw, but they had their own person hand sewer, in charge of the hand sewing. That end of the business ended up growing more rapidly than we wanted to worry about, so finally we said, wait a minute, you guys worry about this thing, we'll set you up on the other side of the building, and we said , get your own management and all 15 that kind of other thing, you know. And so they did, and they did have some labor problems with that company, and so I got in-, I got involved a little bit at that time, just to help them out, but also when the union was trying to organize their factory in those old mill buildings, you had the same stairways, everybody's coming up and down the same stairways, you know, so if they handed out the fliers on the things, they were also handing them out for our people and all that. So that, I, that's the only one I think that I can remember. Roger, can you remember any other?"
"RN:","No, that's it."
"TJ:","That's the only one that I can remember, it really didn't have anything to do with us, but we, we weren't sure at that particular time, but it had to do with them."
"RD:","So you never had any, had to deal with any strikes by your employees (unintelligible word)?"
"TJ:","Oh yeah , yes, we did ."
"RD:","You did, okay, can you tell me about that, or?"
"TJ:","Yeah we did, yeah, I can tell you about that."
"RD:","About that one, you 're talking about you had one strike? T J: Yeah, we had one, we had one, we had one."
"RD:","That's pretty neat."
"TJ:","Yeah , right. Well, first I'll tell you a funny one, because, which before I tell you 16 that one, we thought we had a strike, okay, and we thought we had a wildcat strike. And what it was, was in the morning, Bruce had gone to our lasting department and the quality wasn 't good , and so Bruce was, was a, was a (unintelligible word) and he'd go down, and rai-, he raised (unintelligible word) , and, so that was, that was in the morning. And I, I think it was a Friday or something, I can't remember when it was, and then all of a sudden, at twelve forty five or well, lunch was what half an hour, was it, Roger?"
"RN:","Twelve to twelve thirty (unintelligible word)."
"TJ:","There's nobody in the last room. Oh, my gosh , we've got a, we've got a, we've got a wildcat strike on our hands, oh gosh. And so I talked to Bruce, oh gee, maybe I was too rough on them or something, you know. Then somebody came, five minutes later, was like, hey there's a lot of voices in the elevator, the elevator's stuck. And we went down, and sure enough, the whole last room had gone out, they'd gone out, had a beer at lunchtime across the street, The Pastime Club, and, and then, and the elevator, and, and the elevator got stuck, and they're all stuck in the elevator, so, so we, we really didn't have a strike at all, they got stuck, that was the only reason , but word happen to-."
"RN:","That was before my time."
"TJ:","Yeah , they happened to be all together, anyway, because they had gone out for a beer."
"RD:","So, it's another connection to the French Canadians, The Pastime."
"TJ:","Oh yeah, The Pastime."
"RD:","The Pastime was important. 17"
"TJ:","Oh yeah. Anyway -."
"RD:","Okay, that was, that was the French, right-."
"TJ:","That was, that was, yeah, the, the actual, the actual strike that we had, (unintelligible word) actually I have some old newspaper articles, was, was during the, we had a wage or price freeze, I don't even remember, I, I wish I could remember that time, but it, we had our wage freeze , it was a freeze on wages and prices, it was price controls and wage controls. And the way they instituted it was that there was a certain percentage that, of your wages that could increase, total wages, okay, and I can't remember what the percentage is today, but it was, let's just say it was eight percent at that particular time, and it was during the high wage, that high wage period and they were trying to bring down the inflation. And it didn't mean that you couldn't give that person ten percent, the only problem was you had to give that person six person to make up for it, because you could only do eight percent in total, okay, so that was the whole thing. And we had decided that now we're in this thing together and we're going to have to pretty much give everybody whatever the, the rate is, and that's the end of it. And we had some cutters, who wanted more. Well, I said, the only way you can get more is, we have to give less to everybody else, and we're not going to do that. And so they, we, I think we had ten cutters at the time, and they walked out, and I said, I'm sorry that's way it is, I mean we're not going to change that. And we kind of felt, that politically, that was probably the best thing anyway because we knew that we've, well, we did feel that the rest of the factory is going to look at those guys and say, you guys got to be nuts, you know, and you want more, so I get less, you know, if they'd truly understand the situation. And what happened was, I'm saying, hey, that's it, and one of the things when we did set up the factory was that I would say between Bruce and I, we can do just about every job 18 in that factory. I had been trained as a boy, I worked in the shoe factories . So I went back cutting shoes. We, several of them decided, no, it was the wrong thing, and they came back."
"RN:","We had some outside cutting."
"TJ:","We had some outside cutters cut to get through the period, and then we trained our own cutters, and we trained a whole new batch of cutters, but I'd say, of the ten, three or four maybe."
"RN:","Three."
"TJ:","Three. Three that I can remember. I, I can't remember."
"RN:","They, they came back, they had (unintelligible phrase)."
"TJ:","Three or four came back. We wouldn't take a couple back, and I, our foreman, he, he cut, I cut, and we had other outside cutters who, who, who we contracted with to get through the period, and that was it."
"RD:","And that was the only strike you've, that's the only problem you ever had?"
"TJ:","Yeah, that's the only one we had."
"RD:","So your workers seemed to be pretty satisfied then?"
"TJ:","I, I, I would hope so, you know, I mean you're always, everybody always grouses about their job and all that kind of (unintelligible word). 19"
"RD:","Did have an opportunity, did your employees, whether they were management or just the lowly worker, or the guy in the middle, did they have, all have the opportunity to, to participate in suggestions, or how to make things better, or did you use any of that."
"TJ:","Roger probably could answer that one better I, I can. We did try, you know, I mean I have to say this, that we did try to move with the times. You know, at the beginning, a, it was a very dictatorial system, I mean, man, there's no doubt about that. And, and, but I think we did try to move with the times and get people to take responsibility for their jobs and to get their input into things. We, we did have teams in the end , in trying to do team projects, and brought people from the floor to even be the team leaders, to, to do some of the projects and designs and other things we did. And , I'll be honest with you, Rachel, those types of projects take a lot longer to do that way, than the old dictatorial system of, let's go do it."
"RD:","Let's do it, yeah."
"TJ:","And at times, you wonder whether, you know, whether, gee, is this really worth it. But I think it is in the long run , you know, but, but it was tough sometimes."
"RN:","And overall, I was kind of disappointed that after I had left, and after you left, they, they reverted back, you know, to the old methods, in the certain departments that we had. But if, if you want to make it work, you could make it work, and we did."
"RD:","Let me ask you about, you know, they talk about industry really ruined the Androscoggin River, and what not. Did the shoe industry have any part in that, was there anything that you guys had to do to discharge in the rivers , we re there dyes or things that you had to use that -? 20"
"TJ:","No, no. Fortunately, our industry, we did use some solvents and glues and things like that out of the factory, which we had to be very careful about, and by that time, we, we had safe rooms and all that kind of business, which, which we built and Bob Roy built. Bob, Bob was, Bob, Bob Roy was a, he, he, he took over those mills and he really helped that town by taking over those mills, there was no doubt about that. And you know, I think we always, we always tried to do the right thing. As soon as we knew that, wait a minute, this, this containment methods and things like that for, for these flammables and all this, we're going to, we're going to do it. Well, well we had some of the old shoe dogs in our building, some of the old people who had been in the business for a long time, and they didn't want to spend a nickel. And so Bob, because of like insurance for his building, said, the heck with it, I'm going to build it for everybody, I'm going to build one on every floor, and charge you for it, if you don't do it yourself. Well, we'd already done it, so it didn't make any difference, but that's what he did, you know, the heck with them , he wasn't going to have someone ru ining his rate too, because they're not doing what they should do. So he was a tough old buzzard , but he did it right, you know, yeah."
"RD:","In the French Canadian fam ilies we noticed a lot of what was happening was the, the man would come home and bring the paycheck and give it to the wife, and she would take care of the budget and the family and the household things and everything. Do you find that, did you find that, do you have any inkling as to whether it was like that in the shoe industry also?"
"TJ:","Oh yeah , and Roger, did you tell her the story, or shall I tell it?"
"RN:","You tell the story. 21"
"TJ:","Okay. I've got to tell the story because, because this is very indicative of, of that. One of the things, Rachel, I did believe in that a company is, its, its success should be shared by, by its workers, its owners, its customers and its community. I, I was a strong believer in this."
"RD:","Yes, you were."
"TJ:","And so, we had installed a profit sharing plan early on, which is, which has led to the 401k plans, but was way before they had 401k plans and all that kind of business, we had it a long time ago. And so, it's basically was the profit from the company went to the employees, and , and a certain percentage, and then we came along and I wanted to up that percentage, but the problem was that I didn't want to be paternalistic, in, in that talking with, Roger was, was really handling our human relations at the time, and in my conversations with Roger, wait a minute, you've got some young people who really need the money now, you've got other people who are getting closer to retirement and they want the money for retirement, so if you 're going up the percentage of, that you're going to pay in , in the profit sharing plan, let's devise something that would work for both. And so what we did was said , okay, I think in this case it was ten percent of the profit?"
"RN:","Was (unintelligible phrase) ."
"TJ:","Was this one. This was the additional, because we were already paying out, I think, fifteen percent of the profit, and this now another ten. And so what we decided to do, what we're going to do, we're going to pay this ten percent out and we're going pay it on a quarterly basis in cash, but at the same time, we're going to set up, the 401 k plans had now come into being, they had just started, we're going to set up a 401 k plan, because we already had the other profit sharing plan going anyway, so that you're going to get this money, but if you are at the age 22 that you're worried about reti rement, you can put it into the 401 k plan and not pay taxes on it right now, but if you 're young and you need it for a family, you take it, okay, fine. So that seemed to, that seemed to solve the problem that, that I had with being this paternalistic, let them make the decision. So Roger went around and talked to everybody, and I think we had a very high percentage of people who had decided to put the money in their 401 k plan. Am I correct?"
"RN:","I think that's correct."
"TJ:","Yeah, very high percentage, but some people didn't. Now remember, this is a quarterly check, right, that we were going to do this on a quarterly basis, and you know, what it was, is you signed up for a year, and then you could change your election the next year. And so after the first year, all of a sudden, a large amount of people changed their election, from the 401k plan to get the money."
"RD:","Right away."
"TJ:","Right away. I was bothered by that, so I asked Roger why. Well he said, I'll find out, so he went out to find out, and talked to people, (unintelligible word) and came back. And he, what it was, was that people found out that the quarterly check came as separate check, it didn't come as one of your weekly checks. So coming as a quarterly check, your spouse would not know that this thing is coming . So therefore, when you got the check, this was your mad money."
"RD:","Oh my goodness."
"TJ:","Okay."
"RD:","You're kidding me? 23"
"TJ:","Right, and so what they found out was that's the way the check was being sent to these other people, so gee, that's sounds like a great idea, my husband or wife won't know about it, and I, I have my, that extra check for myself."
"RN:","And what was surprising most to me, was the fact that there was as many women that wanted to stash that as there were men ."
"TJ:","Okay, so does that answer, that was a long way around to answer your question"
"RD:","Yes, that's, no, but that's, that goes to show -."
"TJ:","But it was very telling as to, as to what it was. You know, the weekly check, that goes home, everybody knows what we make, but this was a little extra. Yeah."
"RD:","It's funny."
"TJ:","Yeah, yeah."
"RD:","Well that gives a pretty good overview. Is there something that you can think of that you haven't talked about that would be important? I, I know your being part of the community to me was very important, because you were a very giving man and very, you know, you made sure that you were part of the community. Could you talk a little bit about that?"
"TJ:","Well, I guess the only other (unintelligible word) ."
"RD:","You seem to try to stay involved , you know."
"TJ:","Well, I, I think the, the only other thing is, is, I (unintelligible word) really well, that's all, the, the company, and I, I are so concerned, I think, our industry should 24 take care of, of those constituents that I mentioned, you know, and that the profits of those (unintelligible word) of our industry should go those constituents. And so even in our gifts, and Falcon did, we did give the American (unintelligible phrase) IRS and we gave it the Lewiston-Auburn area, because we said we're giving for our employees in this area. And, and believe me, you know, all of our customers would have us, you know, give to this, you know, thing in New York City, or this, this and all that, and we were able -. End of Side A Side B"
"TJ:","We gave it the Lewiston-Auburn area, because we said we're giving for our employees in this area, and, and believe me, you know, all of our customers would have us, you know, give to this, you know, thing in New York City, or this, this and all that, and we were able to, to say, you know, no, we give it to our local community. So, we did kind of quietly, you know, participate in a lot of organizations in the community. That was just because of my belief, you know."
"RD:","And it, it was appreciated, a lot of people still remember it."
"TJ:","Well, hopefully that's it."
"RD:","Yeah, they do."
"RN:","But without a doubt, but everything was done, as he said, very quietly. He was the type of man that he is, so that's so."
"TJ:","Well, it was good, we had some, you know, we had some good times, really funny times, and great times. 25"
"RN:","Great times, very good dinner meetings."
"TJ:","Dinner meetings and all that, yeah. It was really good."
"RD:","I went to visit, well I went to, to do some shooting , take pictures with Roger, and I was amazed to talk to some of the people who were still there, that have been there since they started in the shoe industry at sixteen, and they're eighty four and they're still working, and they love it. They wouldn 't want to stop, or what not (unintelligible phrase) , like I was totally amazed , you know. Did you have a hard time deciding, why did you decide, why did you decide to leave the business?"
"TJ:","Oh, well, what it, what one thing do -."
"RD:","Was it just time to retire?"
"TJ:","Well, no, no, what it one, you know, I could see that, that we were having troubles, struggling to survive, and at one point we were up to four hundred employees, in the end we were probably two hundred, we had stabilized at two hundred, two twenty five, or something like that. And you could see this, this foreign competition coming, miles away. And I participated in Washington , representing the small manufacturers in the trade cases and all that kind of thing, but you knew it was only a matter of time. And so, so we did specialize in doing very high quality, low volume footwear, real technical footwear, which we felt would be the best survival for the company, and I knew that really, that was where they were going to survive, and our largest customer, well one, we almost went under in nineteen, late eighties or early nineties, when our largest customer, Dunham, went broke. But we sailed, we, we ended up taking over Dunham, the Dunham brand ourselves. But I realized in the long run , that the factory was, was really excellent in manufacturing its product, but that it was not going to 26 survive marketing wise (unintelligible phrase) , because everybody was going to go to China. You could just see that it was happening . I had gone there, looked at their cost structures are and all that kind (unintelligible word) , and realized , boy, we're in trouble. And the best way for the factory to survive was to align itself with the person who ended up buying us, which was Iron Age. And what it was is they were a safety boot company, and they would come in to a company, we'll say General Motors, and say, we will take care of all of your employees that need safety footwear, you give us the contract, and we'll take care of them. And that's how they operated . Now the problem is that at General Motors, they'll probably need fifteen thousand pair of footwear in a year. Now that's great, but the big numbers, if they're big enough , even Iron Age is going to buy those in China. Okay, but in order to get that order, fifteen thousand pair from GM, you had to take care of every pair of boots they wanted , not just the, the, the big volume items. And if they hire a Vietnamese woman to work in their junkyard , which they did , okay, she has a size three and a half foot, she has to have a pair shoes with a steel in-, insole in it for puncture proof. Well you , they have to get that size three and a half woman's shoe somewhere, okay, and therefore, Iron Age has to have a place to have it. That's going to be Falcon. So they, I knew they needed us for those peripheral things, I mean we made size, was it twelve or thirteen? Can you imagine that son of a gun? I wouldn 't want to meet him in an alley, you know, this huge, humongous, thing with a steel insole in it. Okay, so Iron Age is going to get the order from GM, because they can supply everybody. Iron Age is going to go overseas for the cheapest ones, for the majority of the shoes, but there's going to be those peripheral things that they need , that are not big volume, and they need a factory like, like Falcon, and I felt that's how we're going to survive. And what happened was Iron Age came to us and said , we have to have that, we need you. I said, I know you do. And so they said, we really want to buy that 27 factory. It happened sooner than I wanted, and then they wanted a ten year contract from me, but I know what it's like to work for somebody else, and after I've worked my whole life, thirty five years long, for myself, I slowly ended up with six years, and so I worked for six years with them, and then they knew and they took over. And unfortunately they went on hard times, which , it's a long other story, but, which is really too bad, because I think that if they hadn't, Falcon would be in heck of a lot better shape today, but."
"RD:","What happened there?"
"TJ:","You know, it's, it-."
"RD:","If they needed you, and they bought you, and all of a sudden."
"TJ:","They did. Well, what happened was Iron Age did one of these leverage buyouts, it was one of those, those deals where these investors take over, and they were, they were, believe me, they were big investors. I'm not, I mean, these were, these were not individuals, these, these are the Cornell University Endowment Fund, the MIT Endowment Fund, I mean this is the Calpers, which is the California teachers union, you know, and what it is, is they put, of their portfolio, they put a small amount in these types of things and hope for a big return . And so they bought Iron Age, and then wanted to resell it after five or six years, and that's exactly what happened. Iron Age got bought by somebody, but they resold them in five years, and they made a lot of money. Now there's a whole other group of that same type of people are back in there, and in the first year, the board of directors paid a dividend equal to the investment those people had made in the company, and, and Iron, and Iron Age ended up with very little cash, and from that moment on, they never could catch up, and was in my mind, it didn't have to happen. 28"
"RD:","That's interesting."
"TJ:","It was a financial thing that just absolutely ruined the company."
"RD:","That's almost like what we learned from the textile industry, like Bates Manufacturing, where they were bought out, and then bought out again, and then they, they were left with no cash."
"TJ:","Yeah, the second one was the one that did it. Right, absolutely, that's what happened."
"RD:","And that's when the employees bought it, but by then it was too late, because they were straddled with so much debt and no cash, that they couldn't hang on."
"TJ:","They couldn 't make it. Well, see what it is, is each one of those investors put in, into Iron Age, put in ten million. One million went into stock, and nine million went into bonds, and those bonds were twelve percent bonds. So you get twelve percent on nine million, your investment was ten million . Well, you know, twelve percent on nine, is what? I mean, twelve times nine is."
"RN:","A hundred and eight."
"TJ:","A hundred and eight. So what you've got was a ten point eight percent investment on ten million. Do you follow me? Good . But that one million, for the first group now, that one million grew that each one of those first group, that one million grew to ten. So that first group got, in addition to getting twelve percent on nine million for five years, they got ten million on the one, so they made a bundle. All right, and that's exactly what happened to the next group. They bought it, but then they lost it, okay, and, and what they did was, because I 29 happened to be there when th-, when that second sale went, went through, Iron Age had a plan, and the reason why it was an excellent company was the way they grew, and what they had was they had trucks that went to, to, to General Motors, they had trucks that went to Bath Iron Works and all that, and those trucks were loaded with shoes, and you, when you opened the back door of the truck, they put a ladder down and you came in, and in the first two feet were like two chairs, like this, that were fitting chairs, and there were swinging doors, and the rest of the truck was like a warehouse. So they would go right to the factory, they'd go to Bath Iron Works, and the Bath Iron Works' employee would come up, and on the wall they had the pictures of or a sample of the boot, and the person would go, I'd want that one. They'd say, good, what size are you, sit down. They'd go into the truck for them, fit them, yeah, there you go, you got, and now it's Joe Blow clock number such and such, and they'd charge Bath Iron Works for it. And Bath Iron Works let Iron Age do the, the, the paperwork, and so it worked great. Well, if you understand then, they had a wa rehouse in Portland. Now from Portland , they could do Bath Iron Works, they could do all, they could do the paper mills, they could do everything around this, this stick. They would have one salesman who would sell, and by the way, they, they, the place, it happens to be in Westbrook, they had a store. So in those days, they had the, it was the paper mill in Westbrook, those people went to the store, and all the small businesses in Portland would go to the store to be fitted , but their company paid them, (unintelligible phrase). And so, what would happen, that salesman would get maxed out, as they say, the guy starts playing a little golf, because the truck could only go, you know, if the truck was busy every day of the year doing this business, which they figured maximum was one of those stores would do maybe a million and three quarters. Well, what they would do is say, okay, I've got a store in Portland and I've got another one, we'll say in, in around Boston, and 30 they'd say, well, both of them are maxed out, the salesman isn't, isn't working hard , good, we're going to set up a new one, we're going to set it in Manchester, New Hampshire. And what they would do, they'd take some of the customers from Portland, who are maybe down in Sanford , and say, well we'll service you out of, out of this, this now Manchester operation, and we'd take some north of Boston , that might be up in Lawrence or Lowell, and we'll tra-, and okay, so they would start Manchester with maybe five hundred thousand dollars worth of business, but they were taking a quarter of a million here and a quarter of a million here, now these guys have to get off the golf course and start selling again. And this outfit, when they open the door, it's profitable right away, because it starts with five hundred, because the guy in Sanford, all he knows is an Iron Age truck comes, he doesn't care whether it comes from Portland or whether that thing comes from Manchester. And they set up ten of those operations per year, every year. So Manchester would slowly grow from half a million, and it would slowly grow up to a million three quarters, meanwhile Portland slowly gets back up again, and so doesn't Boston. And they would put ten new centers around every year, now those centers cost money, because you have to, it's a special truck, you have to a warehouse, you have to have inventory, all right. Now that's an investment every year that they make, but they've got built in growth for the next ten years, okay. Well, two years before they sold, the old management, well not the old management, the old directors said, we're going to stop putting in these new things, because we're not going to make this ten million dollar investment for the next two years, because we're preparing this place to sell. What they're doing is they're cutting down the growth that's going to happen in the future. Do you see what I'm saying? So there's ways to do that, and , and I saw that happening when, my last year, when I was there, I knew exactly what was going to happen. There was nothing I could do. You know, I mean, I, because I, I had a director 31 over me. I'm just a (unintelligible word) , but I, I am, and I said , oh boy, I could see this happening, you know."
"RD:","Yeah, let me, in, in this same, kind of like in the same vein, you'd talked about foreign competition. In talking to the workers and, and to the oral histories that we did in the textile mills, it seemed like, it seemed like they were all, most people say, well the textile mills closed because of foreign competition, foreign competition. Some managers say that it wasn't all the fault of foreign competition , that the mills themselves did not try to keep up and upgrade their machinery and their equipment enough to be able to keep up with the foreign competition. Is there a little bit of that, that happened?"
"TJ:","There's a lot of that in the shoe industry. I mean, I would say that's the reason why Falcon survived , because we were the last of the Mohicans, but we did put all of our money back into the machinery, okay, we did put our money back into the machinery, that's why it still survives to this day, although it might be questionable where it goes from here. But, but, and the people who left, that was exactly what I said about them, was, my gosh, they're not keeping up. But the problem is that even in the end , the, the differences were too great, and, and, so we had to, we had to specialize. And if you specialize, I felt that we could probably survive, and I, I think, you know, they could, but we lost people. You're not going to have two hundred and twenty five doing the specialty work."
"RD:","Yeah. You said that you went and you studied what they did in China, and, and the costs and whatnot. What was, what were they doing so different, is it just the cost of labor, that gives them the big advantage?"
"TJ:","Yeah, well because-."
"RD:","So, it's the cost of labor. 32"
"TJ:","The problem is the cost of labor, but it's also, well, well, you see that's it, the footwear industry."
"RD:","So, what makes it so that they can do it so inexpensively versus what we're doing?"
"TJ:","Yeah , footwear is very labor intensive, okay?"
"RD:","Right."
"TJ:","When we get through, we basically, I think twenty seven or twenty eight percent of our costs were all direct labor. That's direct labor, the people in the factory. That's not even the supervisor, such as Roger or someone like myself or the sales. And , and so the higher the percentage of labor in your product, of course, that's the fact, that's the part they can squeeze, and, and they do. And so it's not only just the direct labor, but it was also their supervisors and things like that, took a heck of a lot less, and, and so that's really where, you know, where it started. And when you're now dealing with a product that's we'll say, well let's say we sell for forty dollars, over ten of it is labor. And their costs were less than a tenth of ours after, so now you're dealing with a lot of money, and a big amount of money. And what we discovered through the Dunham brand, when we owned the Dunham brand , that was interesting in that in the, like this was early nineties, nineteen hundred, nineteen nineties, we, we stressed that we were US made, and we had the yellow boots, you know the yellow boots just like you'd think of a Timberland boot and all that kind of thing?"
"RD:","Yeah . 33"
"TJ:","We made those and sold those. Dunham was actually the first one to make that boot, by the way. And we knew that we could get the sale at the retail level as long as we were within ten dollars of an imported, an import from China. Now that was back then, I think right now that probably isn't the case. I think people now accept Chinese footwear better than they did back then. But that was the magic number, as long as we could stay within ten dollars at retail , we were okay. And when we had to go to fifteen dollars at retail more than, than the shoes made in China, imported, then that was when we, we saw the nosedive on, on those stock numbers like crazy. So it was kind of like a magic number that the, that the Americans were pay an extra ten, but that was it."
"RD:","Yeah, very interesting."
"TJ:","Yeah."
"RN:","Ted, could you, could you talk a little bit about our flexibility, you know, where we started with kids shoes and how we converted from (unintelligible phrase)? What was the cause of those conversions? I mean what happened that you had to do these drastic changes overnight?"
"TJ:","Well, any, any business, you know, it's funny, I mean there is, there is a thing and they, and they call it the sigmoid curve, and it's an ess curve, and when you get to the top, every time you, you have to almost reinvent yourself. I, I believe that now, not, not that I really believed it then, but I believe it now, because there were, there were two major things in the thirty five years that we had that were very major in the survival of that company, when we hit those curves. And one was when were making just boys shoes, but we were making boys shoes for, at the time discounters were big, and I say discounters, they were, I'm trying to think of them, who do we have in Lewiston, oh, golly, was it Butfields? It's a 34 shopping center where, where Sears is now, that there was a building that now the, they have a part of that shopping, it's the other part of the shopping center, but there was a, there was a discount store there, big brand, can't remember who it was, I can't remember who it was, but, but they were big. Unfortunately the footwear that was sold in those discount places were specific footwear houses that you might go to a Zayres, but Zayres didn't run the shoe department. This company called Morse ran the shoe departments in Zayres. That type of thing, and so it was that type of Zayres store, okay, which they were big at the (unintelligible word) , they were the first big discounters, they were big all through the United States, all of those types of them, Mammoth Mart, and-."
"RD:","Ames."
"TJ:","Yeah , Ames."
"RD:","Ames, that's it."
"TJ:","There was another one, right, all those."
"RD:","Sue's."
"TJ:","Right, you know, those, those, those, it was those types of stores, there were, and we, our boys shoes sold in those stores, because we were less expensive than anybody else, but the quality was great, and actually even Jamie Wellahan used our shoes. He would sell the big brand, Stride Rite, which was the, which was the kids brand , and then he would use our brand as the house brand , and we even sold a Stride Rite, they'd buy our shoes, but I mean you could also buy them in Zayres, so that would , that would tell you really where we were, you see. But the major volume was in, was in those discount stores, but we also sold 35 people like Jamie Wellahan. And what happened was prices, leather prices rose rapidly, and those stores didn't want to go up in price to follow the leather market, so they wanted us to make vinyl shoes and whatnot for them, because they wanted to keep us as a supplier. One of our big fortes was that we did what we said we were going to do, well that's big. And so, we decided at that point, no, we're going to go with the quality, and we would find our own markets, upscale markets, and so we left them all within one year, and redid our markets, and went after the better grade markets, and at that time that was a big thing, as to whether we would survive, and we did. And we were able to get into those markets, and, and got into the top quality shoes. Then what happened was, our idea was that we would go to a Jimmy Wellahan and say, you know, of all your businesses, women's shoes are fifty five percent of your business, men's are another thirty five percent of it, and girls' are the small percentage, and boys' are even, the smallest percentage you got, you know, two or three percent, so spend all the time worrying about your women's and men's business, and we'll take care of your boys' business for you , we will be the ones who will go out. It was a fashion business in those days, because little boys wanted, that was the teenage years when everybody wanted to follow their big brother or (unintelligible word). And so we said, every year we will research the market, we will come out with the styles that you need, you know, for, to hammer the boys' business. And that's exactly what we did, we researched the world, we kept all these products, we built new products, every year was all new products. And we would go to that customer, I thought you'd be, here's what you need, you know. And we would give you maybe two or three different choices, then you could choose them, depending upon your area, but we'd studied and knew what would go in the Northeast, what went in the South, what went in the West, out in California, all that kind of business, and we did that, and that's, that's what we did for people. 36 Well, then athletic footwear, we could see that happening, and as athletic footwear started to happen , we realized , oh, oh, this is a problem, because athletic shoes, if you remembered them, they had all kinds of swishes on them and all kinds of stuff, and we were concerned as to whether we would be able to compete, because now the Chinese were coming in, although actually it was Taiwan, in those days, and, with that. And so fortunately we were working with United Shoe Company developing the computer controlled sewing machine, and that was back in the early seventies, was the early seventies. And we saw the computer controlled sewing machine as to one way that we could put all these parts together, and, and be able to compete with the Chinese, which we did. And that's how we ended up developing that, that technology with United Shoe Machinery too, and came up with that. But even as we went along with that, okay, now we can compete with them, one thing I saw was that the kids, I saw in several places that if adult brand put in a kids shoe, that the kids wanted the adult brand no matter what they had to pay for it, and I realized that, that was going to happen, and that, that's exactly what happened in athletic shoes, that the kids wanted the Nikes and all that, and you could see, and the athletic part of the boys business was just growing like crazy, and I could see that was going end up with the adult brands that wanted to come down and make little kids shoes. And when that happened, we knew we had to get out of the little kids business. And so that's when we, knowing we were good, technical specialists, we got into polyurethane, which was another technology, and we started pushing that because we saw all the opportunity to make mens' boots using this high tech material that nobody wanted to touch, because it was, it was such a, at the time, it was a chemica l process, and so we, we talked the developers of this process, which is an English company, we talked them into giving us a machine for nothing . And that we would do these projects for people as a demonstration 37 project, and we said, we know the people to make this project happen, or this product happen, and that was Timberland, we'll make these shoes for Timberland , and when they finally, our success had, then they'll have to buy the machinery, so you give us the machine, let us be the machine dealer, and we'll, we'll, we'll sell the product that way, and that's exactly what happened. Those machines were worth a million bucks apiece. We couldn't afford that for all the tea in China, we'd got a given to do it. And, and in the end, we bought them."
"RN:","We had to, we had to buy."
"TJ:","You know, we had to buy three of them, but the very first one, we got given. So, that got us in the, the mens business and the mens technical shoe business, which we felt was the only way we were going to go. And, and as we, as we made those major shifts, the problem was then as I told you, the big volume items are going, you're going to make these tech-, high technical products, that means that your people had to have multiple skills, so they could move from job to job and all that. And we really spent a lot of time, that was part of our education process and all that, was to cross train, so people could do many jobs. And so we could do this diversity, that we knew was the only way we were going to have to survive in the business. And that was a big part of it, I'd say."
"RD:","So in your experience as a being a manufacturer, because I guess your family, your family was in it too, and everything -."
"TJ:","My, my grandfather came over as a shoemaker from Sweden ."
"RD:","From Sweden."
"TJ:","Yeah. 38"
"RD:","Okay, when you look at America today with all the manufacturing processes going overseas, where do you feel that, in your opinion, where do you feel that's going to leave America?"
"TJ:","Oh, I, I, it just scared the heck out back in those days, you know, when we were going through. And I can remember that I was concerned , when I was presenting the shoe case to the, to the government in Washington. Have you ever had to present anything to the senate groups or something like that? It reminds me of the inquisition. You sit here, and believe me, when you see on the TVS, they're elevated, you know, they're, they're not on the same plane. Those senators and representatives are elevated. They're , they're up, so you're looking up at them, and it's, it's a very intimidating thing, that, that room and that chamber that they're in . You see it on tv. But believe me, you know, you have to be there, looking up like this, man, you , you know, you, it's intimidating. But I can remember saying that, you know, what are we going to do, we have these skilled people, but, you know, they didn't study computers back in school, and I'm talking about the people who were forty and fifty years old in those days, you know, they have got another twenty five years of work. And you know, they're not going to be computer geniuses, they're not all going to, you know, go, you know, work for Microsoft and all that kind of business, you know, which was the talk at that time, but we got to think about what we're going to do with those people. I am concerned, and I do think that's the reason why what's happened is this wage level thing has, has, has, you 've got this diversity, you've got this diversity -."
"RD:","High, low."
"TJ:","Income, high, low, you know, and, and it's just bothers the daylights out of me, 39 because I saw it. And I saw manufacturing, which were good jobs, which, which, which people had to get experience to learn, and so therefore you had to pay for it, and those are the jobs that had disappeared. And now I, I, it really bothers me, it really does."
"RD:","Okay, is there anything else that you can think of? What was the highlight of your career in the shoe industry in Lewiston-Auburn?"
"TJ:","Oh, I don't know of a highlight, there were an awful lot of good times, you know, the factory gave me a surprise party. I'd have to say those were, those were, you know-."
"RN:","We gave (unintelligible phrase), but the parties that, that Falcon gave for the employees too, I mean we celebrated everything and anything, you know, that was Falcon's theory, that hey there's a reason for a party, let's party. Our biggest one was probably our twenty fifth anniversary."
"TJ:","That was fun."
"RN:","We celebrated that for a full year, every week we would have drawings, for, for all kinds of gifts, I mean you name it, vacations, we, we had -."
"TJ:","Yeah, that was great."
"RN:","For, every week, during the course of that year. At the end , on the bash date, the twenty fifth anniversary, that (unintelligible word) as well. You know, I've, I've yet to have that video, Cookie had that video-."
"TJ:","Oh really. 40"
"RN:","And that will be part of, of-."
"RD:","The archives."
"RN:","As well."
"TJ:","You know, we, we, we feel great."
"RD:","You know, it's funny, because you're talking about this type of thing , and you always hear that the textile workers and the shoe workers, they were overworked, and it was dirty work and it was this and it was that, and yet, when I had the mill workers reunion , and we tried to get the people to come back, which we're going to have a shoe workers reunion, by the way, next year."
"TJ:","Oh really? Oh wow."
"RD:","Yeah, next spring. We weren 't sure whether we were going to get kicked in the shins or heart or whatever, you know, because, you know, we've heard all these things, and yet when the people came into the mills, they'd come in and they'd walk on the floor and they'd go, oh, I'm home, oh wow, this was my piece of equipment, and they'd, they'd pet it as if it was like a, you know, and big tears, and I worked on this for forty, this was my machine. It was the pride they had in the-."
"TJ:","Well, each, each machine had a personality too. I mean, it had a quirk, I mean you, you, you worked on a machine, so you know what, so you know what I mean. And man, you worked on -. 41"
"RD:","It was theirs."
"TJ:","The other guy's machine and it was different."
"RN:","It was different."
"TJ:","There was something different about it, you , it, I, I, I, it was, yeah , you know, -."
"RN:","(Unintelligible phrase)."
"TJ:","Whatever it is, it had a personality, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"RD:","Well, yeah, it was amazing to see how they were talking about the dirty lint, and the noise, and hot and, and whatnot. They were talking about that they had a job, and they, they raised their families, and they were proud to be working, and you know, we were, it was like, it was really, it was beautiful."
"TJ:","Well, you know what it is, is we produced something. You know, it, as I always said, I was proud to work in the shoe industry."
"RD:","That's right, they were proud of their bedspreads, right."
"TJ:","Because we, we ended up, if you really think about it, we took an offal, which is hide, which th-, th-, th-, they don't saw the animal for the hide, they sawed it for the meat. The hide is five percent of the darn thing. It's offal. And we turned around and made it something useful, and that was fun , and to know when you get through , we produced this thing from , you know, from something we were going to throw away. And, and so there's a pride in that, you know. And I'm not so sure that in a service industry, unfortunately, that you can have that, that, that 42 pride, you know, I, I, I, I don't know."
"RN:","Rendering a service is not rendering a service, (unintelligible phrase). T J: Yeah, it's, it's, it's not producing the same, yeah , yeah. You had a physical thing , you know, you could put your hands on the gosh darn thing. I-."
"RD:","Well-."
"TJ:","Love working with leather, man, that was, that was exciting, that was fun . Leather, the leather made the business fun , because it was unique, you know."
"RN:","Leather making business?"
"TJ:","No, the, just using leather, well, oh, the leat-, the tannery business, oh, that's, that's a different story."
"RN:","Well, that's quite a business."
"TJ:","That was quite a business too."
"RN:","Thinking about (unintelligible word)."
"TJ:","That mean, you talk about, you know, with her first question, you know, about the drainage and all that kind of stuff, pollution, and all that kind of business with that industry, whew, that, that was their problem, yeah, yeah."
"RD:","Well, that's good. I think we've got, I think we've got a, can you think of anything that we've left out, or have we covered pretty much? 43"
"TJ:","I still have my, my, my, my bag."
"RN:","Yeah , like my, my cloth bag with the, with the, with the (unintelligible word) dolls."
"TJ:","(Unintelligible word) dolls."
"RN:","Yeah, yeah, you sold at the, the yard sale, but kids sold it, you got it back, they bought it for you."
"TJ:","But I'm saying (unintelligible word) . You know the velvet bag?"
"RN:","Oh yes."
"TJ:","The velvet, the velv-, the blue velvet."
"RN:","(Unintelligible phrase) our twenty fifth anniversary, there were, all employees were given a, a velvet bag , tied with a little white ribbon with writing -."
"TJ:","We need the bags."
"RN:","With your name and the amount of years you were employed. Every employee received twenty five Susan B. Anthony dollars for, for the twenty fifth anniversary, plus one dollar for each year of employment, so I had my little purple bag with forty four dollars-."
"TJ:","Plenty of these weighed a ton. With that many silver dollars, they were -."
"RD:","He will have to, we'll have to find somebody that is -. 44"
"TJ:","I still have mine."
"RD:","Willing to, that still has it, willing to part with it."
"TJ:","I still have my bag."
"RD:","Those are parts, part of the things that, that make the story of, of the, that puts the human in the stories."
"TJ:","Yeah, I still have mine."
"RN:","I still have mine, yes."
"TJ:","You're rich."
"RN:","I have."
"TJ:","Yeah, yeah."
"RN:","I have mine, Ariel has hers."
"RD:","I was going to say that the other-."
"TJ:","(Unintelligible word) interview the others."
"RD:","That's the other thing that I was going to say. If there's, if, you know, as, as people clean out and whatnot, don't throw anything away, Ted."
"TJ:","I wish, I wish I, you know, unfortunately when I moved to the island, I did move a,"
