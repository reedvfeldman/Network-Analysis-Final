"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Fiommedieu) September 3, 2008 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Brickyard Workers Oral History Project. The date is September 3rd, 2008, and I'm at the home of Jeannette and Richard Morehauser. And I saw on my list your name was Dennis-Morehauser, hyphenated, is that how you use it or you just put that because Dennis Brickyard is on my list? Jeannette Mor;hauser: That's my maiden name, so I just use Jeannette Morehauser now."
"AL:","Okay, and where and when were you born?"
"JM:","I was born in Auburn, at home. We all, all the children at home, you know, in my family, were born in home, excepting the youngest daughter, and she's fourteen years younger than I am."
"AL:","And what is your date of birth?"
"JM:","5/7/31, May 7, '31 ."
"AL:","In what part of Auburn did you live, in the area where we are today?"
"JM:","No, well yes, right on the Brickyard Circle, exactly where the, in front of the brickyard . The brickyard was way in the back of the house."
"AL:","And where was it located?"
"JM:","It was located at 23 Brickyard Circle. At the time it was known as Old Washington Road, because-"
"AL:","Is that where Washington Street is?"
"JM:","Yes. You know where Crystal Spring is? It's directly, it's behind that, yeah, on the old road ."
"AL:","And so when you grew up, there was a lot of brick making happening around you?"
"JM:","Oh yes, all the time."
"AL:","Tell me about your experiences growing up, being near the brickyard. JM : Oh, well we were young, and I do know that when my grandfather first started the brickyard it was known as Joseph F. Dennis Company, and then later on it was changed to Dennis Brick Company."
"AL:","And so you have memories of your grandfather?"
"JM:","Oh yes."
"AL:","Can you talk about -?"
"JM:","He was a nice, he was a small man. He was very nice and warm. But we, when my sister Pauline, you've met her, Pauline Turcotte, we used to go down when we were younger- she's two years younger than I am - and we used to go down the brickyard a lot. And especially when they were burning a kiln, which was night and day. And even during the day we used to go and watch the men work, you know. And they had the water struck and the wire cut."
"AL:","So they made both kinds."
"JM:","Yes. And the wire cut, they had the antique, which this is, this fireplace is antique brick, and then they had another kind that they used to make from the wire cut, and they called it the tapestry bricks I think and , you know, they had little lines through it, up and down."
"AL:","I've never heard of those."
"JM:","Yeah, so they didn't make as much of those, but they did. And earlier on I know that they used to furnish the streets of Boston for pavement, for sidewalks and, you know, little side ways, little streets. That's in the early days, because I was told that when I was younger and I always remembered it."
"AL:","And today we're at 174 Sunderland Drive in Auburn, and this fireplace that's sitting in front of us was made from Dennis bricks."
"JM:","Right, it was built with the house, thirty-four years ago."
"AL:","Did you all build your house yourself?"
"JM:","Yes, we had it built, right. It's a pretty big one, huh?"
"AL:","And so can you talk about some of the processes that you observed in the brickyards?"
"JM:","For the water struck, they used to have a pit and a machine in front of it which actually mixed the clay. They mixed the clay and the sand and water or whatever, and they would mix it to a consistency that the men would take- I forget how that worked, though. Oh, it went into another machine where it grinded it more, and they, then they used to take that and they had molds and the clay was shoved into it - I don't remember what - but then the men would put the trays, they were really just square molds made of wood and they were all sized up, about, I think it was about six of them at one time, and then they'd put it on a wheelbarrow and then they would lay that, they would invert it on the ground , on the flat ground, and then pull that out and the bricks would dry that way. They were dry before they would build a kiln to burn them, and then it would turn, you know, red brick. But the wire cut was a different process. They had similarly the same, but they had a huge, huge machine inside a building, and they had a chute and they would throw the clay in, they would , you know, a truck would haul the clay in, because it was all clay around the area, so they would put the clay in and it would follow through and go into this machine, and they would mix it up with water or whatever they used, and that would come out and it was the size of a brick, and it would go on a conveyer and it would go on to this machine, like a flat iron type of thing only it was all wires. And once the bricks fell to the end of that conveyer, they would bring the handle down and it would cut the clay portion into bricks. And then those were put on racks, they had rows and rows of racks and, you know, they had little slits like, and they would put pallet, they would come off on pallets and they would just take them down, wheel them out into those racks- we had , oh, tons of them- and they would just put them up on the racks and they would dry in a different manner. They had about, oh, seven layers, and then they were dry, and after they were, you know, drying somewhat, then they would separate the bricks so they would dry completely. It was all by hand, really. And then later on they would know when it was time to make a kiln, you know, they have to dry real well, and then they'd pile them up - now what did they do? They had a certain way of handling the bricks and they would start building a kiln. A kiln was a, they'd start it from scratch, and they'd start from the bottom naturally, and the men would, you know, they would haul bricks to - my uncles were the one that was building the kiln itself, because you have to, they had to be done in a certain manner so when they would fire it, it would go all the way through. And the men would throw that, oh, I don't know, it was four or six bricks at a time, they'd throw them up and they'd catch them, and they wouldn't fall apart because of the manner that they stacked them up. And then they would , it was so long."
"AL:","Now, it was your father and brothers? How many were there?"
"JM:","There were four of them. My dad was the oldest one, and he took care of the office and the book work. And I used to help him, you know, not much but I was always in there. I always liked to work with figures and I used to help them, little things, you know. Not much, but yeah. It was fun."
"AL:","And so your uncles were out in the brickyard doing the process, or managing the process?"
"JM:","They were doing the work and, you know, instructing the others what to do, at first, but after a while you didn't need to tell them any more. And in fact, Harvey Desgrosseilliers used to work there."
"AL:","Yeah, for a while. Do you remember him from that time?"
"JM:","Oh yes, I remember him, because sometimes when they did build a kiln, I can't remember, it was huge, it was about, let's see, from the door to the end of the house, and just as wide. And then they had these arched doorway like every so often. As they built it, they had the doors, you know, they were putting bricks around it so they could have a room to put the fire in, because it was all wood process at the time. Later on they changed it to oil, but most of it was wood that I remember the most."
"AL:","Now did your family own land from which you cut the wood and supplied the fires?"
"JM:","They did at first, but then naturally they ran out. No, they used to contract for people in the woods, you know, my dad would go out every once in a while to get somebody to cut wood at their place, and then they would haul it back, you know, he'd have to, like a salesperson, I guess, you try to get the, to make sure they had enough . And it really was slabs, they called them, because they were the flatter one."
"AL:","And the middle pieces are what you'd probably sell (unintelligible)-"
"JM:","No, oh, I don't know, they had them make it specially to fit that, too, so it always came just perfect so everything was burnt."
"AL:","And now how many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"JM:","I have two brothers and I, I had two brothers, they're both deceased, and they both worked there for a while, long time."
"AL:","What did they do at the brickyard?"
"JM:","Oh, well they did all kinds of things too."
"AL:","They learned the whole process?"
"JM:","Oh yes, most everybody that went learned all the process they could."
"AL:","It was hard work, I'm told."
"JM:","Oh yes, it was hard work. Very hard."
"AL:","And how many sisters do you have?"
"JM:","I had three sisters, we were four girls."
"AL:","Four girls and two, so a family of six. What was your mom's role?"
"JM:","My mom, my mom was just wonderful. She would, she did everything, and she made ice cream and then once in a while she'd make some and they would, the men would say, did your mother make some ice cream today? Then she'd go down and, I think she sold them for a nickel or something, you know. It was a long, long time. And they used to love her ice cream. And I remember Harvey one time, I don't think he remembers that, he was around seventeen I guess, and he had worked at night and he was going to work during the day too, and my father said, well, he says, you go up to the house, he says, and my wife will make you breakfast. She used to do that, she'd stop whatever she was doing, she'd make breakfast, sometimes she'd make lunch for some of the men that didn't bring their lunch. And you know, at the time there wasn't that many little convenient stores around, so."
"AL:","Right. Well that was nice."
"JM:","Yeah, that was, that was wonderful of her. She had six kids to take care of and she was making food for the others. But my father was a generous person, yeah. Everybody remembers my dad."
"AL:","And what was your dad's name?"
"JM:","Laurent."
"AL:","Laurent?"
"JM:","Laurent. And my other uncle was William. Oh, you've probably, they, he died last December, December 3rd , I believe."
"AL:","We got a photograph of him, but not an interview."
"JM:","No, no, he was too, I used to ask him things sometimes, you know, but then he wouldn't really remember. He remembered a lot but, you know, it's kind of late to do that stuff."
"AL:","So that was one of you r father's brothers."
"JM:","Yeah, he was the oldest of the other brothers, then there was Laurier, who they called Larry, and then the very youngest was Rosaire, they called him Ross. So there was quite a difference there. Because my dad , there must have been three girls after my dad, and then William. So I remember my dad saying that he was working at the yard when he was seven years old, you know. Probably not -"
"AL:","Probably (unintelligible) the bricks on the sand or-?"
"JM:","I think, I don't know what he was- probably, probably, I don't know which, I think that was the oldest process, too, the water struck, because they used to lay them down on the ground."
"AL:","Okay, and we were talking about, well we were talking about your mom and -"
"JM:","Oh, my mom and what she did, right. Yeah, she used to, oh, I knew a lot of the men that worked there. And even today, I'll see someone, they say, are you one of the Dennis girls? Because we were, the three youngest are pretty much the same age. My older sister's between my two brothers, so she's, hm-hmm. So they say, are you one of the Dennis girls? They would always get our names mixed up, but they knew who we were."
"AL:","And so you lived in the Auburn area all your life? JM : I've always lived, yeah, I was born and brought up on Washington Street, yeah."
"AL:","And so how long did the brickyard run for? You said your brothers worked there, throughout their careers or it closed before they retired?"
"JM:","Oh, no, because my brothers eventually got their own place in Sidney, Maine, but it was quite far and then they kind of gave it up, you know, after about five or six years."
"AL:","And where did they do this?"
"JM:","In Sidney."
"AL:","Okay, outside of Waterville."
"JM:","Exactly. And they gave it up, it was too far, and they had young kids. And one brother wasn't that interested in it, so didn't make any, they didn't make it. But they worked for a long time at, for my dad and the brothers."
"AL:","And your husband Richard, who was just in here, mentioned that sometimes you would run into people. Can you talk about that, who were some of the workers, do you remember them?"
"JM:","Oh, I can't, when I see them I remember their names, and a lot of them have since deceased, the ones that I knew the most. And I can't remember any. Oh, my cousin's husband used to work there, and she's married to Michael McGraw, who's a coach at Lewiston High School. I don't know if, used to coach basketball, I don't know what he does now, what he coaches. He also teaches. So he used to work there. And the younger, my younger nephews worked there, but I have older cousins and younger cousins, and I think the ones that have been interviewed were the younger ones. So they don't really, you know, I mean a lot."
"AL:","Do you have names of some of the people who you think would be good to interview? Because I, I know that's a big challenge for the brick making, we didn't have very many names to start with. Anyone that you think would be good, I would love to find them and ask them -"
"JM:","I would, I can't really remember anybody living. I have another cousin that used to work there, I believe, Richard, Richard Dennis. And he lives on Sunrise in Lewiston, but he's never home, he's a retired teacher now and he's, his sister lives in Florida so he's always off."
"AL:","Is there anything that I haven't asked you about regarding the business and all that, that you feel in important to add?"
"JM:","Oh, my mind is a blank right now. I know when my sister and I were little, we used to go down sometimes and, for the wire cut they were on racks, you know, and we used to write on the bricks before they dried. And the next morning my grandfather would go make his rounds, and he knew it was us, he let my mother know, keep those girls away. Oh dear, that was bad. Oh yeah, I knew a lot of the men, but the ones that I've known the best are all deceased. There was a Wilfred Wilson, there was a Bill Belanger, Armand Madore, and Ben Provencher, the ones that- in fact at night Ben Provencher used to come and skate with us, we used to have a huge pond and we'd build a bonfire and some of the men would come and skate with us. We had a lot of fun when we were young, yeah, things we used to do like that. But as far as the brickyard I, you know, much more than that I can't recall right now."
"AL:","Do you remember when it closed?"
"JM:","Well, I know that they were in business since 1903, and let's see now, that's for sure, but I know, my cousin had done something for his father once and he had called , he had called me to, you know, give him some dates and things like that, but at the time I fell , broke three ribs, punctured a lung, and I wasn't in tune to that. So he went ahead and did something, you know, wrote up something for his father. And I th ink he said the date that he thought it was 1912, but it was 1903. But I never, I did tell him that once, but I don't know if he remembers ."
"AL:","Well, do you think it was about 1980-ish when you think it closed?"
"JM:","I would think so, because my father retired , he was seventy-five, and he was seventy-five when? Oh, he was seventy-five in '7 4 or '75, because he was born in 1899. So he retired then, and then they had it, I'm sure they worked in that for at least five years, so it would be the early eighties when they, it was, then it was just the three brothers working, I mean you know, carrying the whole thing. And then I guess they were getting older, and they sold the land and that's, that would be around in the early eighties. I don't have a precise date because I wasn't involved, I didn't, you didn't notice that much."
"AL:","So you worked with your dad in the office in the earlier years, when you were quite young and then you went on to other things?"
"JM:","No, he stayed there until-"
"AL:","No, you."
"JM:","Oh, me? Oh yes, then I grew up."
"AL:","So you did that as like a teenager?"
"JM:","Oh yeah, oh yeah."
"AL:","Okay, so you didn't stay there through -"
"JM:","Oh, I didn't, even earlier than that. I used to just go in and help him. I mean I wasn't paid for anything. But I didn't, it didn't even dawn on me, I wasn't working like a full day or anything."
"AL:","Right, but you saw how the office ran."
"JM:","Oh yeah."
"AL:","Orders came in and things like that."
"JM:","What did you say?"
"AL:","Like orders for bricks would come into the office in some manner I would suppose, and then they would try to fill the orders?"
"JM:","Yeah, I don't think they had any sales person as such, it was just word of mouth, and people in need , they would, you know, call up, they knew about them and, because they were one of the earliest ones to have that. And prior to that my grandfather used to work for his uncle, who had a brickyard way up off Main Street in Lewiston."
"AL:","Oh, really? And do you know what that brickyard was called?"
"JM:","I don't know what it was called."
"AL:","Oh, I'll have to find out."
"JM:","But we used to go visit, and we always used to call him Uncle, and his name was Henry- he'd go under two names, he'd go under Henry Brooks, and Henry Lacasse. And I don't know, but that was supposed to be, I heard that that was his uncle, but I don't know, I can't get the connection between the two. I don't know if it was because my grandfather was younger and he always called him uncle or what, you know. And we used to go visit, it was Uncle Henry, and her name was, I don't know what her name was, but we used to call her Aunt Kluffy. I don't believe that's her real name."
"AL:","Well it was a small brickyard probably? Fairly small?"
"JM:","Do you know where Brooks Avenue is in Lewiston? You know where the Androscoggin , the Androscoggin Hospice is in Auburn, and then you have one in Lewiston on Main Street? It's not a hospice but it's a, they help people, you know, they treat people in homes. Well it's almost across from there. And it was right in the field , and it's no longer there, it hasn't been there for years and years, I can't remember when."
"AL:","Yeah, it would be interesting to know (unintelligible)."
"JM:","Because I don't even, I don't remember seeing that myself. I just heard about it through my great uncle, or whatever he was."
"AL:","Well great, thank you so much for your time."
"JM:","Oh, you're welcome."
