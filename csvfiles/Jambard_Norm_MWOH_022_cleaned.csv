"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) February 14, 2006 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Mill Workers Oral History project. Today I’m interviewing Normand Jambard at his home on Jefferson Street in Lewiston, Maine. This is Andrea L’Hommedieu, and the date is February 14th, 2006. Could you start just by pronouncing your full name for me? Normand Jambard: Normand Jambard, J-A-M-B-A-R-D."
"AL:","And what is your birthdate?"
"NJ:","Fourth July, 1924."
"AL:","And were you born in the county?"
"NJ:","No, I was born in Van Buren, Aroostook County."
"AL:","And did you grow up in that area?"
"NJ:","Yeah, up to the age twenty-one."
"AL:","And what was it like in Van Buren in those days?"
"NJ:","A small town, probably at the time, I don’t know exactly if it was over six thousand or seven thousand. And I don’t think it grew much anyway. It’s a small town, it’s right near the border of Canada, New Brunswick."
"AL:","So was there a large French population there?"
"NJ:","Oh yeah, it was all French at that time, mostly all, you know, because so close to Canada, you know. But if you go twenty-two miles out, then Caribou would be all English I would say, and Presque Isle and those places."
"AL:","That’s a big difference in a short -"
"NJ:","But it’s nice country up there, though, beautiful country."
"AL:","And what were your parents’ names?"
"NJ:","Well, my father’s name was William Jambard, and he was from Canada but when they moved the whole family to Van Buren he was only eight years old, so that that name seems to have been Bard, and they don’t know for sure how they pronounced it. They don’t know if it’s Bard, Bower, or what. They tried to make a family tree, but they couldn’t because they couldn’t find out for sure, you know, what the names were. They went to Canada and can’t seem to find out the right source to find, you know, what it really was. 1 But them days, you know, a priest could change the name, you know. And they had changed my grandfather’s name to Jambard. He said, this is an English state, you know, state of Maine, so he changed it to Jambard. And, you know, it took all these years here to find out what the real name is, Jambard."
"AL:","And your mom’s name?"
"NJ:","Well, my mother’s name was Emma Roy, her maiden name. (Name) was the place that they found the real name Jambard, because there was a girl here that got married with a Jambard, she thought she would have to invite me and she called first, and I says, if they don’t know any Jambard from Van Buren, they are the real Jambard we’ve been looking for all this life, where they got the name from. But that’s what happened."
"AL:","And how many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"NJ:","Thirteen of all, and since WWII we had been, up to seven years ago, we had been ten of us, seven brothers, three sisters. But one of them passed away, the oldest one, just about six, seven years, or maybe close to ten years now."
"AL:","And where did you fall within the family, in the middle?"
"NJ:","I was fourth."
"AL:","The fourth?"
"NJ:","Yeah. Well, I say the fourth. There was a couple before me, I mean before, I’m talking about since WWII. Yeah, we were a big family."
"AL:","What did your family do for social activities?"
"NJ:","We had a farm back in Aroostook. Them days was in horses days, 194-, in the ‘40s, father his own farm, and in fact he started that in the ‘30s but later on in the ‘30s, when he bought that farm, and they worked hard both of them. I had good parents, and it’s a good family, they’re all with their spouse. But one of my sisters lost her husband quite a few years ago, the oldest of the sisters, and my older brother passed away, so I still got a, his wife still lives in Van Buren. Now, after a while they, to get jobs, you know, because there wasn’t a choice of job, we all, all us kids, you know, at the time, as adults at the time, we went to, they went to a, nine of us went to live in Connecticut and find jobs there, and so they lived there until their retirement. And I’ve been, I’m the only one that moved here to stay since then, in November of 1945. And I got myself a job here at Bates Fabric, you know, and I wasn’t an electrician at the time, I had to start somewheres, you know? I remember being what they called, the name of the job was a batcher. That’s, the cotton was all coming through the ceiling, going through a machine, and I had to make the slips. For a year and a half. But during that time I had met my wife, she passed away two years ago."
"AL:","She’s beautiful."
"NJ:","And she, anyway, she was working days, so I went, I swapped jobs, I went into the packing room, did a few different type of jobs, and I was doing Army goods at, that last job in that area, packing bedspreads for the Army and the different, not just the Army, I mean for sailors, you know, and so forth."
"AL:","Right, the mill was very busy during WWII, wasn’t it?"
"NJ:","Oh yeah, there was over two thousand people there when I went in in November of 1945. So 2 after, I think it took me seven years in there before I could get a job in the shop. See, we had to sign at the time, you know, in anything. And I was signing to (unintelligible word) of a better job. And at the time, you see, we had a kid three years after we got married, but he had (unintelligible word) of the heart. So he, we knew he’d die one day to the other, so we didn’t want to leave him of course, you know, but we went different doctors in the city and we ended up, four years afterward I guess, something like that, Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts, and they told us there was no hopes and he died a year and a half after that. So he was five and a half years when he passed away, and we didn’t have any since. I mean, since that, you know."
"AL:","I forgot to ask you, what type of farm was it that your father had?"
"NJ:","Potato farm."
"AL:","Potato."
"NJ:","Yeah, potato farm and grain. It was an, I think it was an eighty acre farm, you know, with just a little wood on it. Not much, it was mostly all farmland, you know, ready to plow."
"AL:","What kind of transportation did they use to get the potatoes to the market? Was it by train?"
"NJ:","Well, I should say yes, it was. You know, we had to take it down to a potato house, then from there, you know, it was distributed by train and trucks, you know, when they started to have more trucks around, and that’s way back. Yup, and you had to work hard on the farm. We were brought up working hard. I remember after high school, I worked three years with my father in the woods in the winter, you know, we, he would job, my father was a, and my mother, they were both working hard. My mother was always, had more than she could do right in the house, you know, feeding us and cooking, you know, and taking care of our clothes and all of this. And with the daughters, my sisters, they would work just in the house with her, too. So it was a busy, busy situation at the time."
"AL:","And growing up in your home, did your parents both speak French?"
"NJ:","Yeah. The only time we’d probably speak English was when somebody, English, you know, would come over and talk with us. My father was a good, he was a talker. Yeah, he’d, you know, he was self-educated. In them days these old people, you know, I mean our parents, they went to a school but I mean not, probably just the grammar school, you know, both of them."
"AL:","And so when you went to school, is that when you started to learn English?"
"NJ:","Yeah, some, yup, yup, yeah because we had both, you know, in school. But at the lower school was French mostly, you know, excepting we had a few subjects like geography, history, that was English. Yeah, they had to teach both ones, because we had some English people, too, you know, in Van Buren. They were mixed, but mostly French them days."
"AL:","Now, you said you worked in the mills about forty-four years?"
"NJ:","Forty-four years."
"AL:","And so the first few years was as a -"
"NJ:","Oh, up to seven years was different jobs."
"AL:","Yeah, and then you became an electrician."
"NJ:","You know, for seven, eight years probably. And then I went to school, four years to Lewiston 3 High, nights, in the winter, you know, the whole winter, and after those four years, well after the second year I could go for my journeyman license. But then it had to be another three years to go for my master. So just four years at Lewiston High wasn’t enough, you know, schooling, so I went four years at Lewiston High, no, not Lewiston High, I mean, I went there four years, CMVTI, in Auburn. So after the first year I went there, then I could go for my master. So I passed, but I stayed in there. Less money, you know, working in the mill but it was a steady job. And my wife, I kept her home because having taken care of that kid for five and a half years, you know, being a sick kid, was really hard on her. So I kept her at home after this happened. Oh, she went, doing a little bit just to find out how she could take it, but she was always, back sore or something, you know. So I kept her home."
"AL:","And so what was it like in the mill, what was your job like as an electrician?"
"NJ:","Well, my job, what I like about my job, there wasn’t an (unintelligible word). I started with different guys at first, you know, I didn’t get along with all of the actually, and after I had my master and the oldest one, the oldest guy quit, I mean retired, then I had, because I had a master’s license and I could do the job, I’m the one that had the job. I mean that I signed for. Yeah, they even told me some of them, (unintelligible word) sign, if you don’t sign somebody else will, be from outside. So you might as well sign if you’re going to stay here. So I did. And I think I done my job right. And all kind of work there. There was a machine there, I was the guy being sent on that after my boss had quit. (Unintelligible phrase) there at the time, and his wife had got sick, you know, trouble with her legs. And they had a store, so she couldn’t do the job, you know, taking care of the store. So he took six months out, and I took the job, boss, temporary, just for six months. And I liked it, but they wanted to put me on salary and I didn’t want to because (unintelligible phrase). So I told them I wanted back, you know, be back as an electrician. But then they had different kind of guys, you know, that didn’t know electricity to be as boss, they picked just anybody, you know, and they were from other shops. So actually, you know, I had to do a lot of guiding just the same. What they had to do was put the slips on the table, and I had to, I would pick what, mostly what I would think others couldn’t do, you know, some of them. Like I was, all the transformers in there from then on, in the mill, there’s different sizes, different wiring, different type, you know, and that was one of my jobs there I had to do. Besides, the biggest job was in the Bleachery. This machine was from here to the other side of the street. Covering a whole room."
"AL:","And what did you have to do with that machine?"
"NJ:","I had to find out what the problem was, if it was electrical. Sometimes it wasn’t, but I had to find out what it was. And if I needed some, if I found out it had, I needed a piper or a machinist or, you know, any of the other shop around, what I had to do was ask for it. I had to go see Bill Harvey or somebody that was upper up to send somebody over. But what I used to do is, when I was in that particular room I’d tell the boss of that room what I needed, who else I needed, you know, to do that type of work. This machine had everything, you know, gas. We had to call outside sometimes. It was complicated, it was a complicated machine. I remember perfecting certain jobs, you know. Like they had a cutting table there, we always had trouble, the girls had to get off their seat to go move the spreads, you know, to line it up. And in the card room, they had that room wired electronically. I took parts from there and I figured my own, you know, to make it better. And it did make a big change, I mean the spread would come in straight afterward. There were guides, you know, and these electronic parts were doing the job better. So I liked my job really because, you know, it was lifetime job."
"AL:","And you got to do different things each day."
"NJ:","Oh yeah, from one day to the other, so it’s not monotonous. So that’s one reason I liked it, 4 because one day I’d be working on three, four different jobs, other days could be more, other days just a few depending on, I remember one time, more than one time, they had a machine that would go on fire, you know. So I had to figure out, it’s hard when you don’t have sometimes right (unintelligible word) or something, you know, to do. And these were washers (unintelligible phrase), this was to wash the Martha Washington bedspread. Oh yeah, there was all kind of jobs in there. I think I knew them all at the end. I don’t think there’s many, I don’t think there’s many machines I haven’t been on. I think I’ve been on most of them. That I could remember. I don’t know of any that I haven’t been on during all these years."
"AL:","In what ways did the technology change in the mills while you were there?"
"NJ:","Well, some of it, you know, was like we had new looms. Now, these new looms I think were making three times or more, they were a faster machine. And I was asked to rewire those (unintelligible phrase). And I told them what I thought was best, to rewire them overhead, you know, on the beams so water, there was water leaking in that end of the mill, (unintelligible phrase), so when it goes on the floor, and the old type, the old ways they used to do it was to cut some boards, you know, on the floor, and then we had to pipe in, in the floor, then they’d put a board on top. But water, when water goes on the floor like that all the time, water and electricity don’t mix. So by doing it this way, they had no problem with water, with those new looms. But many a time they had fire on the looms at nights, you know, that bad, you know, so we had to rewire all them beneath the floor, but that’s the way they wanted it then. But when they got the new ones, I told them what I, if I was going to do the job I’d do it a certain way, you know, what I thought was best. Sometimes it’s good to take advice from somebody else, even though you’re, I mean you have an upper job. You know, because in the old days things were done differently, you know."
"AL:","Do you remember when those new looms came into the mill, like what decade? Fifties, sixties?"
"NJ:","I’m not sure. But (unintelligible word) though, I don’t know if it’s, well, I’ve been out of the mill fifteen years already, sixteen years I’m out, so that must have been probably twenty years at least before that."
"AL:","So sixties maybe?"
"NJ:","Maybe in the seventies. I’m not positive. I’d rather say the truth, you know, that I don’t really know for sure."
"AL:","What strikes do you remember occurring at the mill?"
"NJ:","I remember one we had, but this was way back and I wasn’t an electrician then, I was working in the packing room. And there were, at that time I found a job right off. See, I wasn’t an electrician but I was a man that could do odds and ends, you know, also, so I got myself a saw, hammer and (unintelligible word), you know, and I went on the turnpike, they were up in Gray making the turnpike and they needed men to make the forms to put the cement in, you know, overpass, over the turnpikes. So anyway, I worked there two, I think the strike lasted two weeks, and I worked there the two weeks. But I went back to Bates when they, well, it rained, I remember it rained probably four days out of them two weeks. So that’s why I figured, you know, it made me think when you’re inside you’re sure of working every days. Unless you’re a sick man, you know."
"AL:","Do you recall what the strike was about? Was it wages?"
"NJ:","Oh, it must have been wages, it must have they wanted a raise. Raises were most of the time about five percent, five, I don’t know if it was five percent or five cents more an hour, something like that. 5 It wasn’t big."
"AL:","And do you remember any other strikes that happened later?"
"NJ:","No, no."
"AL:","Now, the union came in in the late forties."
"NJ:","The union came in before, no, when I went in in ‘45 they had a union already. I think the union started before my time, and I think it’s 1939 or something like that they told me. Because it was closed shop so I had to join. If it’s not a closed job, and like in my case, being, when I was a master electrician, actually if you know your work you’re a good worker, I don’t think you need a union. Shouldn’t say that, but, you know, depends what goes on. But they had a closed shop."
"AL:","Do you recall any, or were you involved in any of the social activities that were going on the mills? I know there was a hockey team, and bowling league."
"NJ:","Bowling, I used to be captain of my team, bowling. This is a ways back. I used to like that, once a week, you know?"
"AL:","So you got to see your coworkers outside of work."
"NJ:","Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did like the bowling part."
"AL:","What were other things that the mill sponsored that you were involved in?"
"NJ:","No, I was too busy. I used to be called nights, you know, sometimes, at Bates off and on, because they wanted somebody, you know, when you get to be master the arrangement was, master electrician, they had to call the top man because the top man is supposed to know more, you know, the one that has a master’s license is supposed to know more than somebody that don’t, or don’t take advantage of their job, you know. Some of them don’t want to work overtime. But me, I was just me working, you know, it was just me, myself. I mean, here, my wife, (unintelligible word), and she wasn’t a strong person afterward anyway, but she was a good person, good cook, you know, she was a good person. I always thought she was a beautiful person. Yeah, she was nice."
"AL:","I know there were mostly Franco Americans working in the mills, but also Irish."
"NJ:","A lot of Canadians, yeah, we had some Irish, yeah."
"AL:","And some Greek."
"NJ:","Yup, I remember one of them, his name was Peter Paraskavakis, him and his wife were working in the packing room. His wife was a desk person, office person, and her husband was a, packed bedspreads in boxes. Yeah, I remember that. And then the other guy, an Albanian, Selim Hassim. These were two elderly person, you know, older than I was. They’re both gone today. But they were all good friends for me."
"AL:","No rivalries among the ethnic groups?"
"NJ:","I don’t remember seeing anybody there, you know, in the packing room, no. Could have been in other rooms, I don’t know. But people got along in the packing room good, yeah. And same thing when I was, even had before I got married. I was working as a batcher, you know, after the first year and a half that I was in Lewiston here. Then I moved, I started, like I said, in the packing room and worked there, I 6 don’t know, it was seven to eight years, seven years anyway. It takes time when you’re not known, you know, and they don’t know how much you can do and so forth. But I think they were very satisfied with me. I was told so, in fact, by Mr. Lebel himself."
"AL:","So you know Fred."
"NJ:","Oh yeah, oh yeah."
"AL:","What was he like to work with?"
"NJ:","I knew Fred, the family. Well, he had a job to do, you know, he was a serious man. Yeah."
"AL:","Is there anything that I haven’t asked you about the mills that you think is important to add?"
"NJ:","You know, what I meant to do and I didn’t have the time to do. Because I, you know, I don’t like to stay alone in the house too long so I go out, you know, shopping or what. And what I meant to do is, I could have wrote, you know, everything that I could think of. But it didn’t happen."
"AL:","That’s okay, no, that’s fine, this has been great. But if you have other thoughts that you think of, you just let me know."
"NJ:","I think the best thing sometimes to do is, if they want it that way, those guys like Fred and, those guys that you mentioned that you’ve seen, you know, where they thought of me as a master electrician at Bates, they would know that I, I didn’t hide on my job. I kept going after one job to the other. Many a time I remember, instead of waiting for the elevators, because we had our shop in the cellar, and this was a nice room just the same, you know, but it was the lowest floor, cement floor. So many a time instead of taking the elevator I’d run right to those stairs way up. There was five floors on one end, I mean from, let’s see, almost to Ash Street, it was five floors up there, right down to Chestnut Street. And on this end, where they had Number 5 weave, with those new looms I’m talking about that they had bought at the end, at the end, so many years, you know, that was only two floors. Yeah. But as far as liking that type of work, yes I did. But I never knew what I’d end up in, you know. When I first went in there actually, you know, probably I didn’t know a bulb from a tube. But by going to school, you know, it does it for us, it’s the best thing a person can do. Not just training on the job. Schooling. Both. They had the same opportunity as I did, all the rest of them in the shop, and there’s just a few that went, for a while there in the shop. But they keep going there. And there was others from machine shop, and I don’t know if they had a, from the other shops, I don’t know if any of them went. But they were good to us, paid out dues, you know, paying for everything."
"AL:","The Bates Mill helped pay for everything?"
"NJ:","Yeah, you know, to get a better, give us a chance to better ourself, do a better job for them, which is good."
"AL:","Do you happen to know if in later years newer people were given that same opportunity to have them -?"
"NJ:","No, not really, because the mill went down, see. In fact, my wife would have now been on crutches, you know, because she had fell down, you know, when I was sixty-five. I would have stayed with them to the end. I could have stayed until I was seventy-five probably when they quit the mill. That would have been, what, five years, well, I quit in ‘69, another ten years would have been, not ‘69, ‘89 I quit, it would have been ‘99. Yeah. Oh, I’m just like anybody else. When I was, up to the time that I retired, I mean I take pills and 7 stuff like that but, now I’m on different kind of pills, I’m on Coumadin, you know, and a few things. But, I mean I do what I have to do. I’m okay."
"AL:","And can you tell me how Lewiston, the community of Lewiston has changed from the time when you first moved here in the forties, until now?"
"NJ:","Well, when I first came here everything was located, the stores and all that stuff was on Lisbon Street. You go on Lisbon Street, it was hard to dodge everybody to go walk on Lisbon Street. And then they had all these places, you know, malls, you know, here and there, so it gives you, well, it’s because there’s more cars, you know, they started that. So they have better places to park without walking half a mile or a quarter of a mile to go into a store. See, you can park right now anywheres around down the the street here with a car because you got a lot of parking spaces, with those buildings they built just to park cars. But the thing is, you have to walk a little ways from all of them. I mean, to go to where you want to go. And it’s a problem to park your car in a place like that, and go down, and come back to it and so forth. While if you go shopping you park as close as you can to wherever you go, and it’s no problem. You go in, you come out, you know. I like to go shopping. One reason for that is because I’m a guy that likes everybody, you know, and I like to meet people, always like to meet somebody new, you know. I remember sometimes, you know, certain people in the mill were so quiet that they were looking sad. And if I’d be close to where I was working, I’d try to put a few words in before I’d go back to get another job, you know, to them. Eventually, they were talking with others, you know, and they could move around. But, you know, you like to see people happy. But people are different, you know. Just like when I came here, I was so bashful, you know, I had a hard time facing people, face to face, some of them. But you get used to that, you know. When you’re brought up, you know, way up Aroostook, on a farm specially, you just go weekends to town, it’s a different story. Of course I was single then, I was, I mean, it’s a different story all together. But I can still say, you know, it’s been a lifetime job, so I can’t say anything wrong about it."
"AL:","Great, thank you very much."
"NJ:","Oh, you’re welcome."
