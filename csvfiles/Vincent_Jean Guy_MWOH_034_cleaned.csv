The date is March 22nd, 2006, and I’m interviewing Jean Guy Vincent at his home on Webster Street in Lewiston, Maine, and this Andrea L’Hommedieu. Could you start just by telling me your full name? Jean Guy Vincent: Jean Guy Vincent."
"AL:","I like the way you pronounce it. And what was your date of birth?"
"JV:","May 26, 1940."
"AL:","And where were you born?"
"JV:","Here in Lewiston."
"AL:","Were your parents from here as well?"
"JV:","My father was born here, my mother was born in New Brunswick, Canada."
"AL:","And what were their names?"
"JV:","Dominique and Cecile."
"AL:","And how old was your mom when she came to Maine?"
"JV:","Oh, let me see, around late 1920s. I think that was, say, about ‘25, something like that."
"AL:","So was she still a child at that time?"
"JV:","No-no, she was a graduate from Normal School in New Brunswick, that’s a teacher’s college, and she came to Rumford, Maine. She met my father who was a, working for his uncle, Vincent Bottling Company. Just a second."
"AL:","Vincent’s Sparkling Beverages? And that was in Rumford?"
"JV:","No, New Auburn. They went out in about ‘67."
"AL:","So how far did your father’s family go back in the Lewiston area?"
"JV:","Oh, I think 1860, something like that. Because I’ve got the whole thing on record, the genealogy, my sister’s doing the genealogy and I’ve got copies of everything."
"AL:","Now, did your mom speak English in the home, or French? 1"
"JV:","French."
"AL:","And your father?"
"JV:","French."
"AL:","French, so you grew up in a French household."
"JV:","French household."
"AL:","And at school, did you learn to speak English at -?"
"JV:","Yup."
"AL:","Now, what part of Lewiston did you live in?"
"JV:","I lived in New Auburn most, until 1987. Then I sold that to my niece, and I bought this one with my nephew, he lives downstairs with his friend."
"AL:","And so what was it like to grow up in Lewiston in the ‘40s and the ‘50s?"
"JV:","Well, it was mostly in New Auburn I stayed, so."
"AL:","Yeah, well, I’m sorry, you know, in this community?"
"JV:","Oh, this community here? Well for one thing, I could walk and go into any apartment on Knox and Bates, they were all clean. Today you can’t do that, you can’t even walk down there in the day time. Back then it was all different. Little Canada, there was five thousand French Canadian, ten thousand French Canadian families, and everything was clean. Very little trouble with the police. But in the late ‘60s that started changing."
"AL:","Now, how many brothers and sisters do you have?"
"JV:","One each. My sister (unintelligible phrase), she has a home in Florida, (name). She’s got an apartment in my old building that I sold to my niece, and she has a trailer in Litchfield."
"AL:","And so at what age did you start working at the mill?"
"JV:","Nineteen sixty (unintelligible word), twenty."
"AL:","You were twenty years old."
"JV:","That was really the only thing, plus Hillcrest Chickens back then, those were the two only things that they had around here, or shoe shops?"
"AL:","For jobs?"
"JV:","Or shoe shops. But I preferred the mill."
"AL:","And when you started, you started the Hill Mill?"
"JV:","Yup. 2"
"AL:","And what did you do there?"
"JV:","I picked up the reworkable waste, supplied the piece workers with what they needed to work with. I did that for ten years until they closed it in ‘69, and I moved to the Bates."
"AL:","So you worked until they closed, and how was the Hill Mill and what they did different from what the Bates Mill did?"
"JV:","The Hill Mill made cloth, they didn’t do any finishing work. They made cloth to send to other mills, other companies. Basically it was a cloth mill."
"AL:","And when you came to the Bates Mill, what was your job there?"
"JV:","That was, first one was in the picker room, opening bales, cleaning the ductwork and stuff like that. Taking material upstairs with the elevator, big rolls of what they call (unintelligible word) cotton, and we took them upstairs. They had that when I first started, they didn’t have automatic chutes to feed the system upstairs. But at the end they did."
"AL:","And then when did you go to the card room?"
"JV:","When I first started at Bates, and I worked in the card room at the Hill, too."
"AL:","And what is the card room?"
"JV:","Okay, that’s where the cotton first gets worked. It comes in the picker room, goes on cards, and then gets into big cans, then it goes into draw frames, it gets winded, then it goes into, at the, in the mill, at the Bates it went into what they called (unintelligible word) to get the big spools off, like this, spools of yarn. Then it went upstairs in the spinning mill, yarn mill. That was, they made the big warps to go on the weave room, in the weave room, you know those big warps you see in the weave room, that’s where they made that. Then they had a finishing (unintelligible word), they finished their own products at the Bates."
"AL:","And so in terms of working conditions, how was the card room?"
"JV:","Oh, it wasn’t that great in the ‘60s and ‘70s."
"AL:","In terms of the air quality, or -?"
"JV:","Air quality wasn’t that great either."
"AL:","Was it clean?"
"JV:","Oh, clean in a way, but not the way we do it today."
"AL:","Now, were you involved in any of the extra curricular things that they had?"
"JV:","I was a union officer at the time. Not too long, but that’s about it."
"AL:","Do you remember any strikes?"
"JV:","No, we never had any strikes since I was there, (unintelligible phrase)."
"AL:","Did you get involved in the bowling league at all? 3"
"JV:","No. I watched them, I didn’t get involved in any of those, no, no."
"AL:","Who were some of the people that you worked with, or worked for, that you remember?"
"JV:","Well, they’re mostly, the supervisors are mostly all gone now, I think they’re all gone. One was Pontbriand, Chip Pontbriand. The, I remember the manager of the Bates Mill, who was it? It was, Maurice Lavoie was there for a while, and the, I can’t remember the name of the manager, who was it, the Bates, at the Bates Mill at the time? Maybe you should have that on record."
"AL:","The president, or -?"
"JV:","Beginning with the president. There was a president, then there was a resident manager who ran the whole thing, then they had superintendents that run that, I don’t know, his name was Donald (name), he was a superintendent. Then they had what they call overseers, department heads, like Chip Pontbriand was department head. Another one, they had him upstairs, was a yarn, they were, each, each room had their own overseer. And under the overseer they had what they called second hands, foremens."
"AL:","Was Hal Gosselin there? Hal Gosselin?"
"JV:","Yeah, he was in the office."
"AL:","Now, were you there at the time that the Chinese Tang brothers took over the mill?"
"JV:","Last few years I was there for a while. Not too long after that I left, in ‘84."
"AL:","Did they make any changes to the mill when they came in?"
"JV:","Not too much that I know of."
"AL:","If you were to describe sort of your over all experiences with your time at the mills, what would that be?"
"JV:","Oh, we did manage to get a lot of overtime in. It was kind of different, you only did one job at a time, though, not like today. You did not switch jobs to jobs. Sometimes when I was on a job, work an hour, and nothing to do for an hour, and then work an hour back. You don’t do it like that today. They make sure you’re kept busy, especially where I work now. I’ve been there, I’m at Bates College, dining services, been there for nineteen years this year. Semi retired."
"AL:","So you work part time at this point?"
"JV:","Yeah. See, right now, since November I can make any amount of money without losing Social Security benefits."
"AL:","And if you had to look at what maybe was the best and worst parts of the job at the mill, what would you say they were?"
"JV:","Oh, (unintelligible phrase) first few years at Bates I never, I made around three dollars an hour. That was big money back then. You have to bear in mind we had no cable or nothing like that yet, you know, it started coming in late ‘70s. It’s got-, it’s entirely different than today. The only way you could make good money is you had to do a lot of overtime."
"AL:","Did you have a chance to go to the reunion that they held the year before last? 4"
"JV:","Yup."
"AL:","Did you see people you recognized?"
"JV:","Yeah, yeah, quite a few. There’s some I see quite often."
"AL:","Now, I have a question about growing up in the French community in the Auburn-Lewiston area. Do you recall some of the things you did as a family, or as a French community, traditionally?"
"JV:","Oh, well, traditionally, first of course we went to parochial schools, until the seventh grade I went to parochial schools. Then from the eighth grade I went to public schools. Religion was the rule back then. We had big family meals and get togethers. Well, back then most of the family was, was, like now all I have left is cousins. All the rest, the other generation there is all gone. But then I got the new generation, under six, there, I got six, eight of those around so that’s the next generation that’s coming."
"AL:","So you had, so food was something that was important to the family’s social life."
"JV:","Yup."
"AL:","Were there any traditional Franco-American meals?"
"JV:","Yup, they had crepes, they had meat pie, tourtièr, and certain other meals, (unintelligible phrase) they made the French Canadian, when they had a get together. And of course (unintelligible word) was always beer and booze in the old days."
"AL:","Now, before we end I just want to ask if there’s anything that I haven’t asked you that you think is important to add."
"JV:","Well, I like what they’re doing to the mill there, they’re -"
"AL:","Using it for new businesses, yeah."
"JV:","New businesses. There’s a lot of difference today, work, compared when I started to work, compared to some of these high school kids that work with us in the college now, some of them, they don’t show any interest or pride in work the way we did. Yeah, they’re supposed to have some condom-, are they going to have apartments in the Bates Mill itself, or just businesses in that one?"
"AL:","I’m not sure. All I know about is businesses at this time. But who knows? Great, thank you very"
