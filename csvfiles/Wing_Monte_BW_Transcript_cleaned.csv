"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) August 31 , 2007 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Brick Makers Oral History Project, at the Museum L-A. The date is August 31st, 2007. Today I am interviewing Monte Wing, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. Could you start just by giving me your full name? Monte Wing: It's Almonte Jay Wing, Junior."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"MW:","I was born in Leeds, Maine, in 1937, 19th of May, five nineteen."
"AL:","And did you grow up in that area?"
"MW:","Until I was fourteen, and then I came down to Auburn, and I went to work for my uncle in the woods, and then I got hurt, and met (name) , and she asked me, and so, and then I went to something else. And then I might have been sixteen or seventeen when I went to work in a brickyard. So, I started down there, and I used to, oh, I'd haul slabs for the, for the kiln, for them to burn the brick. I worked around the yard, and then eventually I went to work on the clay bank, I'd be driving a tractor. That was a good job. I used to prepare the clay for them to get ready to make the brick with. So, anyway, they used to have these big sheds, and they had these racks in them, and after they made the brick, of course the brick was wet, it was soft, so they'd keep them in there until they dried, until they got hard, so they could handle them, and then put them in a, piled them in a, in the kiln there to burn them. So, I know those, those archways under the kiln, of course they went all the way across, and they used to have these long poles and they shoved wood across in, into the archway. And I've seen guys get so hot that they'd pass right out. Oh, the heat was terrible. Oh yeah, it was unreal. And these guys, I've seen them break ice, they'd go out there in their bathing suit. Of course, there was a lot of water when they were making brick, and they couldn't wear any clothes, they'd just have a bathing suit on. I've seen them break ice out there. It was so cold."
"AL:","Now, what was the season? It was a seasonal thing, right?"
"MW:","Yes, yes, they'd done it all summer, right up to, oh, right up until cold weather. I, I don't know exactly when they stopped, but like I say, it was freezing when they 1 stopped."
"AL:","Now, did you ever have to build kilns?"
"MW:","Yeah, I used to, you handled these brick four at a time, and they had these, these, not surveys, but these belts there, what do I want to call them now. Anyway, they put the brick on the belt, and you'd get in the kiln, and they'd come up two at a time, and you piled them on, on the kiln, on top of the fire there. Of course, there wasn't any fire at the time, but they'd wait until they, until they got the thing built up, and they'd do it that way. These belts, these, I don't know, what do I want, I know, I know the name as well as I know my own, but."
"AL:","Well, if you think of it, you just say it later."
"MW:","So, and they'd pile them all the way to the beams up on top, and they was quite high, I don't know, I never measured one, I don't know how high they was, but, and, and then they'd burn them. They'd get them a certain temperature, and of course, the higher they'd go, the less taller they would be in. Of course, down below sometimes they'd be really dark, the hotter the fire. And then they had, they had a canopy also, and they'd take a forklift and they'd take these racks and they'd put in a canopy, and conveyor belt, that's what I want to say, conveyor belt. And then they had a conveyor belt, it would go over to the kiln there, and we used to work in that canopy and take the brick off, four at a time, and put them on the belt, and it would take them over to the, to the kiln, and there would be somebody in the kiln taking them off the conveyor belt. And they used slabs to, I think they was just starting with oil when I, when I got done down there."
"AL:","And what years did you work there?"
"MW:","Oh, boy."
"AL:","Do you remember?"
"MW:","This, this must have been, let's see."
"AL:","In the '50s?"
"MW:","Yes, I would, yes, it was in the '50s, yes, yeah. And I liked that job on the clay bank, though I mean, nobody bothered me, I, I knew what I had to do, and I'd do it, and I'd drive a tractor all day, I'd break up the clay, of course it was hard. When it was dry, you'd break it up, and then you'd go over it with a, with this other thing that broke the clay up, and it got it real fine. And then they had these big scoops on the back of the tractor. I'd scoop it up and take it up on this, well they had this little building like, and you went up over a hill, and there was grates, there was grates there, so when you'd 2 dump the clay, it would get down. You'd have a truck backed up underneath, and the clay, you'd dump the clay and it would go down through and fill the truck body up. And then I'd take it down and, and dump it into the pits there. So, it was quite an operation, I'll tell you, oh yeah."
"AL:","And at that time, did they still have men down in the pits, with shovels?"
"MW:","Oh yeah, so they had, oh yes, they had, they had a guy down there shoveling, yeah, oh yeah. And that clay, when it got wet, it was worse than ice, I'll tell you. It was slippery. Oh, you're telling me, yeah, it was, it was treacherous, you had to be careful. Of course, we didn't, I didn't work on the bank when it was kind of slippery, anyway, when it was wet, but, but. So, let's see, what else? It's hard to remember, it was a long time ago."
"AL:","Well, tell me a little bit, something about growing up and your family. You lived in Leeds until you were fourteen?"
"MW:","Yes, I did. Well, yeah, I, yeah, I was fourteen. I went to, I was in high school, I went to Leavitt High School for six months. We was a poor family, we didn't have much, so I couldn't go to any of the games or anything like that, and I used to have to walk, oh probably, must have been a mile and a half, two miles to the bus in the morning, and walk back home that night. So after I'd been going there about six months, I, I quit and I left home, I came down here, and I had an uncle and aunt that lived in Auburn. I went to work in the woods, and then I, a log rolled off a truck on me and broke my pelvis bone in two places, and so I didn't work in the woods anymore. And then I, oh I worked in the shoe shop, and let's see, I worked in Bates Mill for a little while, at night. I had two jobs, I worked in the shoe shop days, and Bates Mill at night. That's after I came out, came out of the service. Later on, I went in s-, in the military. But I lived in Auburn all those years until, and even when I got out of the military. I had an aunt that lived Hampshire Street, an aunt and uncle, and I used to stay with, with them. So, and then I had three or four guys that I used to chum around with. In fact, last weekend, we all got together. We hadn't seen each other for I don't know how long. So, anyway, I spent twenty six months in Germany, and then I came home, and let's see, I, that's when I had the two jobs. I worked in the shop days, and I, and that's, that's pretty much it, I guess. It pretty much sums it up."
"AL:","So, how long did you work doing brick making? Was it a couple of years?"
"MW:","Oh, oh, at least a couple of years, oh yeah, yeah."
"AL:","Was it hard work?"
"MW:","It was, oh yeah, them bricks were heavy, and you threw them four at a time. And of course, there was a knack of catching them, so they wouldn't, so they wouldn't be too heavy. You know, you couldn't just hold your hands out and catch them, but you kind of 3 let your arms go and you caught them, so they wouldn't be so heavy. And you talk about taking your skin off. Of course, that sand on them bricks, oh it would, if you didn't, and it was hard to wear gloves, so it would, it would peel the meat right off your fingers. Oh yes."
"AL:","Did you work in teams? I, I've heard about working in teams, like people with the wheelbarrows."
"MW:","Well, kind of relay teams, like (unintelligible word) , like if you were loading a truck or something, we used to, we'd work in, you know, a relay, from one to another, and so on and so forth. One guy would be in the truck, another guy passing to him, another guy passing to him, and so on and so forth , yes, yeah."
"AL:","Were there any people that you worked with that you remember, you can describe, maybe old timers who aren't around anymore?"
"MW:","Well, let's see, well, Raymond Brackett, I distinctly remembered him, and I didn't exactly work with anybody in particular, because I, when I went to work on the clay bank, I was all alone. But these guys, I, I do remember, and I've worked with them. That's Charlie Gordon, and he had a brother too, but Kenny, I think his name was Kenneth Gordon, and I don't know if he's still living or not. There was another guy, Oma, Oma Gordon. You probably remember years ago, where in the brickyard, these two guys beat this guy to death?"
"AL:","No, I never heard about that."
"MW:","You didn't? Well, hew-, this was the office boy, and he was down there one night, and these two guys came in there, and they beat him to death with a hammer. They caught the guys."
"AL:","They caught them?"
"MW:","They caught them, yeah."
"AL:","Were they workers in the brickyard?"
"MW:","No."
"AL:","No, okay."
"MW:","No, no, I, I don't know what they was doing down there, they might have been drinking, or who knows, on drugs, or what, you know, I don't know. Yeah, he was a nice, he was nice man too. In fact, he was, he was related, I think, to this Charlie Gordon, in some way. And then there was another, Earl Gordon there. Like I say, he's 4 the one, I, I think he's got dementia, I'm not sure. I, I see him one day, and I asked him if he remembered me, and he said, no. But he used to be a, like a foreman down there, and he was related to him too. I'm not so sure, but it was his brother or something."
"AL:","Now, which brickyard did you work in?"
"MW:","This is Morin."
"AL:","In Morin, right?"
"MW:","Morin Brick, yeah."
"AL:","And the other big one was Dennis."
"MW:","Dennis Brick, right, yeah. There was, there's another one, Johnny Morin. He was one of the owner's sons. I distinctly remember him, and he must be still around."
"AL:","He is. I'm going to interview him next week."
"MW:","Oh, you are?"
"AL:","Yeah, I got a hold of him yesterday."
"MW:","Okay, I'd like to, I'd like to say, hi, to him. I hadn't, well, I haven't seen him since I worked in the brickyard. In fact, he had a '50 Chevy convertible, and I bought it from him, when I worked in the brickyard, and his father, was it his father or his uncle, oh, his uncle lent me the money and I used to pay him back so much a week until I got it paid for, yeah, yeah, oh yes. So, if you've got any questions, you ask me, because I -."
"AL:","Yeah, do you recall when they would build the kiln up and they would fire the bricks?"
"MW:","Oh yeah."
"AL:","About that, what, could you describe sort of that process? Do you, did you know it?"
"MW:","Well, I think, you know, I think they started with oil, that's what started the fire, and then they'd put the slabs in. They'd get the fire going, and then they'd put the slabs in, if I remember correctly. And hot, oh, oh, that used to get hot. Now, I think they do it, they probably do it all with oil, I don't think they use slabs anymore."
"AL:","So, is there anything about the brick makers or the brick making process that I haven't asked you about that you think is important to describe? 5"
"MW:","Oh, once they got these bricks in the kiln there, they used to have to put plaster on the outs-, I say plaster, I don't know, it was a mix of cement or something, on the outside, it was supposed to keep the heat in. That was quite a, that was quite a process. No, I don't, I don't think there's anything, probably Johnny can tell you a lot more than I can, because his dad was a, was one of the owners there."
"AL:","Well great. Thank you so much."
"MW:","It's all right. I'm glad to help you."
