"MG:","Oh, I came, I was twenty, twenty-one."
"AL:","Oh, so you grew up speaking Greek as a first language?"
"MG:","Oh yes, yeah. And I still, I mix it up, the Greek and American because my first language Greek, so I just stay there."
"AL:","And what made you come to America?"
"MG:","Well, my father came before me, a couple of times, and bring my sisters here. And for a better life, that’s all. Why you come in this country, everybody, for better life."
"AL:","So how many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"MG:","I have four sisters, three and four with me, and two brothers. And one was in, a colonel in the army, in Greece, though, not here, my younger brother. And they all pass away. Just me left."
"AL:","Now, did your family all settle in Maine when you came to America?"
"MG:","No, my, one sister, I came to Lowell, because my sister was one there. She’s the one I suppose, she don’t have any children. No, not just because children, it’s that she wants to bring us here for a better life. So I came to Lowell, I stay a few months, and I came visit to the other sister in Saco, and all the mills there. So my brother-in-law-say, why you sit there and do nothing, and you don’t come here and work 1 and make a little money. And that sounds good, so I just pack my suitcase, came to Saco. And I started to work Jacques Mill. I don’t know if you know, that’s the big mills there, there was, they’re called Jacques Mill, in Saco. So I find my husband, and I marry, and I came here. And, well I don’t go to work right away, but after a while I went to Hill Mill. From Hill Mill, I don’t work too long there, so I go to Continental. So the Continental, I think I work ten years on my life, and I have my family (unintelligible word). I lost my husband, and I stayed home for my children. So that’s my, I like to work. I’m the worker, still, I’m the worker now."
"AL:","Now, what kind of work did you do in the mill, what was your job?"
"MG:","I weave, weaver, yeah. Yeah, I make good money then."
"AL:","Yes, and how many years do you think you worked at the mill?"
"MG:","Oh, I work in the mill ten years, yeah, for ten years. So I lost my husband, and I have to stay home with the kids. Because, you know, so I just worked the third shift, you know third shift? From eleven to seven. And there I, because the kids are small, they go to school, and I want to be here, to them, the time to go to bed and the time to go to school, and I sleep the days."
"AL:","And how many children did you have?"
"MG:","I have five, and I take my niece, too, (unintelligible phrase), so that’s six."
"AL:","That’s a house full."
"MG:","And I used to sew all our clothes, everything, everything, I used to do that at home, and sew for the kids because those days, not everybody have the money to go in the stores."
"AL:","Right. Was there a strong Greek community here?"
"MG:","Yes, well not big community but, bigger now, small, we have a church down on Lincoln Street for (unintelligible word), and now we have the church, the (unintelligible word), we build another one. Now all the, all together they work and we have a small church, but we have our church."
"AL:","So did you have strong ties with the other Greek people in the community, did they support you?"
"MG:","No, no, oh no, we weren’t a group, not a group. The Greek, they stick together because so many, so little, if they separate and have two churches or more. So we work together and, (unintelligible phrase), so they will work together. We don’t ask for, what you belong to, no, no, no. So that’s the main thing."
"AL:","And so having grown up in Greece, you probably learned to cook traditional Greek food."
"MG:","Yeah, I learn there, but I learn from my sisters and we learn from each other here, because I say, we all together. Anything you know, you go to the church and can make it, you know, your recipe or my recipe, all, you know, so we work together, we learn that. Because there, they all let the kids, the young girls work and cook and do all the things. So I don’t know much before I came cooking, but I got two sisters here and they were excellent, and they’re both workers. My one sister work in the Jacques Mill (unintelligible phrase), and the other, and the other one worked in the shoe shop. So I learn, and they cook, they cook for the church, they cook for the family, they cook, they cook, and they will cook. I just start now, because I can do it. 2"
"AL:","And what was your family name before you were married?"
"MG:","(Name)."
"AL:","And how do you spell that?"
"MG:","I can write, not to sp-, I have a pen."
"AL:","That’s okay, we can do it after the interview, okay? That way you won’t have to go looking."
"MG:","Well, I know where they are, but I don’t have it here."
"AL:","So what was it like working in the mill?"
"MG:","That was hard, it was hard. And work the third shift, it’s hard. But I don’t mind then, because I was young and I know I needed the money. My husband he don’t want me to work, he said, that money you’re going to put in a bank or you’re going to burn it. I’m going to put the kids through the college. I don’t have education, my mother died there and my father married again, and I don’t have education, Greek education, just the fourth grade, but I don’t want my kids working in the mill. That’s (unintelligible phrase), I says, you going to learn to have a better job. So she, so they all graduate from college, every one of them. My daughter, the oldest, graduate from University of Maine, a teacher. My son, (name), graduate from Berkeley, four years, that’s the first time there was a term four years, because there was two before, Berkeley. My other daughter which lives with me now, she graduate from (unintelligible word), secretarial, in Boston. My daughter, the other daughter graduate from (name) State College and become English teacher, and my youngest son graduate from University of Maine. They don’t go far from here, they like the Maine. Yeah, so he graduate from University of Maine, he went to law school there and become a lawyer, and now is a judge. So they all have something better for the jobs I have, I learn for myself. So that, and Olympia [Snowe] of course, she graduate from University of Maine, yeah."
"AL:","And she’s a U.S. senator."
"MG:","Yeah, I have her there. And we don’t have much, I will say we don’t have much, but we are a close family, we’re together. Anything come up, (unintelligible phrase) we solve it anyway, but that’s the way I teach my kids. Anything come up, a problem, a good one, a bad one, just, you don’t want to tell me, tell your sisters, your brothers, but not go on your friends. Because the friend’s going to tell the friend, and the friend’s going to (unintelligible phrase). So that’s it, even now, they’re very close, they’re very close. With my five, and Olympia, six, they’re very close yeah. She’s in Washington most time, but just the same. She called me last night, from Washington. Yeah, just (unintelligible phrase) family, it’s nothing, but we try to do it. And they all work for the church, all of them, all of them, no matter where they are, it’s something for the church they give or they work there. They do the festival, everything, they all work there. And I mean, really, they’re close, yeah, they are. Because (unintelligible phrase) a small group, and if you live close together, work together and be together, we’re going to disappear. So this way, we have our church, (unintelligible phrase) at the school, (unintelligible phrase), try to keep (unintelligible phrase)."
"AL:","Well, I wondered if there were many other Greek people who worked in the mill with you?"
"MG:","No one."

"GC:","Who?"
"MG:","Mary Barbalisa. But she don’t go, she don’t, and we decide to go to a mill and give our names, and if they have a job to call us. So there was (unintelligible phrase) and they hire me, because I have experience from Jacques Mill. Little bit, not much, I don’t think I have. But they, we came home and I, and called me to go for interview, to see what that, what can. So I went, they hired me, and I went in."
"GC:","And then what happened?"
"MG:","And I have, I work. I work for third shift."
"GC:","What about the story how you tried to, you had to convince, you women had to convince your husbands that you were going to go to work together."
"AL:","Yes, tell me that story, because I don’t have that on the tape yet, the story about having coffee with your friends."
"MG:","Yeah, with friends, and we decided to go find a job. So we, the three of us, the next day or the same day, we go to Continental Mill and give our names."
"AL:","And how did you convince your husbands to do that?"
"MG:","Oh, that is easy. It’s easy, because he don’t want, I say, your husband, (unintelligible word) I don’t want you to go to work, because I have enough, I make enough money to eat. But I say, I want for the kids, to go in the college. They was young then.
