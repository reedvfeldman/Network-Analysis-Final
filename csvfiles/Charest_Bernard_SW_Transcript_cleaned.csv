"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) April 4, 2007 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview with Barney Charest, on April4, 2007, and this is an oral history interview, the very first one, for the Shoemakers Oral History Project, for shoe workers, maybe is a better word, I'm not sure. You can talk about that a little bit. So I want to start by asking you to give me your full name. Barney Charest: Bernard Gerard Charest."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"BC:","I was born in Lewiston, October 12, 1946."
"AL:","And did you grow up in the Lewiston community?"
"BC:","Yeah, actually a good part of my life was, I grew up in little Canada, right across the street from the shoe shop where I finally worked in."
"AL:","And which shoe shop was that?"
"BC:","It was Commonwealth Shoe, that was in the early '60s. How I started in the shoe industry actually is I got a job, I was fifteen years old, in a place called Maine Stamping, which was in the basement of Koss Shoe in Auburn, and it belonged to Mr. Koss, that owned Koss Shoe, his son-in-law's business. And I used to die leather by hand in the hand cut (unintelligible word) stuff for our biggest customer, which was Koss Shoe. And upstairs in the loading dock, there's a Mr. David Rancourt, and I believe his partner's name was Marchand, I'm not sure, but they owned , they had a small hand sewing factory they opened on the loading dock. And I used to go up on break time and stuff and watch and I was amazed, you know, it was just, to me it was just so cool, you know, to start with two chunks of leather and come out with something really pretty. I asked David Rancourt if he would teach me how to sew, and he told me that at the time that he couldn 't afford, and I told him, I'll do it for free, on my time off and stuff like that, if you want to teach me how to sew, I'll sew your shoes. And he said okay, we'll go for it. And it was really easy for me, and I don't know why, but it, he told me, he says, I'm amazed, he says, I've never seen this before. So then he and Mr. Marchand went their own ways, and David went and opened up a company called Downeast Casual, and I went to work for him full time as a hand sewer. I want to make sure that I'm not skipping anything in there. Oh yeah, that little factory there, that was on the loading dock, was actually horrible. There was no heat, the shoes used to freeze, actually freeze, and the toilet would freeze, we'd have to suffer with, we'd take gloves and cut the fingers off, so, but you had to start someplace."
"AL:","So at that time, in the early '60s is the time period we're talking about, were there lots of shoe shops in the Lewiston Auburn area?"
"BC:","Oh yes, oh yes. At one time in Lewiston and Auburn there was over ten thousand hand sewers. Now there's maybe, working hand sewers, maybe forty. Now there was, oh, we can go down there, just in the Continental Building, across the street from the Saint Mary's Church, there was Commonwealth Shoe where I worked, there was two hundred, two hundred twenty five hand sewers. Upstairs there was Village Shoe, they had a couple of hundred hand sewers. There was two or three smaller shoe factories, and to my mind, they had maybe a couple of hundred hand sewers. So you were talking about five, six hundred hand sewers in the same building. And then there was Goulet Moccasin, and these, these, I'm talking about hand sewers now, how there was Downeast, Goulet Moccasin, Commonwealth Shoe, Billing, Arno Mocassin, these were all, Timberland was another one, LL Bean's was another one, they were fairly large companies. And then just the next building on down was, you had a lot of traditional footwear that was made. There was, what was it they made in the company? They made patent leather shoes, they were like king of the world of kids' tap dancing shoes and things like that, and that was a fairly large factory. I never really got into a lot of the traditional shoemakers until later on in my career, where I had to work with a lot of them for the job that I did, but there was L~ Shoe and Falcon Shoe, there was Dexter, there was, companies made, right there by Dexter, their thing was Norwegian, for many, many, many, many years, the regular men's weejuns. LL Bean's, when they got into making most of their shoes, for casual shoes, boat shoes and things like that. Commonwealth Shoe, Billings Shoe, things were, Billings Shoe was more like WaiMart, Commonwealth Shoe was more like Macy's. The downfall of both of these was actually, one of the biggest reasons there wasn't direct competition from overseas back then, because we didn't have any. Every shoe we sewed was already sold. But back in the middle '60s or so, the women in the United States got feminized, because a hand sewn shoe is a casual shoe, and for many, many years, like the penny loafer, every girl in the United States wore a penny loafer, and then all of a sudden they were out of style. The imports that were coming in at that time, and the companies that were developing new shoes, were giving them a little class, making them pretty, and so the penny loafer went out. And we're talking hundreds of millions of pairs of shoes. So the weejuns, the hand sewn weejuns, the dress shoes, the Brazilians, when they started putting them on the market, Brazil, Columbia, a few factories started putting on the market nice fancy dress shoes. So, the hand sewns went from a dress shoe to a casual, in the large, large part of the market. So we just starved ourselves out of business. And then when these other countries 2 bought into the business of making shoes, they were brand new companies, so all of the equipment that they had was all brand new, state of the art stuff, and we were trying to compete with hundred year old equipment, and there's a lot of things we couldn't do that the newer equipment could, you know, the new machinery. So it was just a combination of a whole bunch of things that, and actually we priced ourselves out of the market, as far labor goes, as hand sewers. In the early '60s, we made big money. I can remember bringing home three hundred, three hundred fifty dollars a week after taxes. Now in 1960, '61, '62, that was a lot of money. The average shoe worker was making forty dollars a week. A dollar an hour was the minimum wage, seventy five cents, eighty cents an hour was the minimum wage when I started, and I used to make five dollars an hour, six dollars an hour, depending. It was a really neat occupation, because if I wanted a raise, let's say if I needed some money next week, I'd shut my mouth, put my earphones on and sew more shoes. We actually controlled, you know-."
"AL:","Self motivation."
"BC:","Yeah, on a good day, if I really just did what I was supposed to do, work, instead of talking about fishing, hunting, women, all kinds of stuff, and sewed in between, if I went in, in the morning, and put my earphones on, I could sew forty five, fifty pairs a day, and which was way above average. The average was about thirty pairs a day for a hand sewer. But if, let's say I wanted to buy a new fishing pole, well first I had to talk my wife into it, she'd say no because we can't afford it, so I'd go make a little more money. Alii had to do is just clam up and do it. It was really interesting, the person that really taught me, there's two guys who taught me how to sew. There was Dick McBride, which was probably at the time one of the best hand sewers in the world , he really was, he was good. And Marcel Grondin was one of the fastest hand sewers I've ever seen in my life."
"AL:","Were they both from this community?"
"BC:","Yes. Sadly, Marcel Grondin died, he was mid-thirties, of a heart attack, and Dick McBride died just a couple of years ago, and he was in his seventies. But Marcel told me one time, he says, you can be fast and good, I'll teach you how to do that. And I did, I became a reasonably fast hand sewer, but probably one that, not to pat myself on the back, probably one of the best in the world, and I've been all over."
"AL:","And so you learned from some of the best?"
"BC:","Oh, yeah."
"AL:","Can you talk about what it was about how they taught you that?"
"BC:","Yeah, well the whole thing about hand sewing is hand coordination and depth perception. And Marcel was really good with, if you want to become fast at anything, 3 you have to eliminate all the wasted movement, and that's how Marcel taught me how to become a fairly decent fast, a fast hand sewer, is that every movement that I need accomplished. So you start knocking down the movement, if you start speeding up the time. And Dick was, taught me how to read the leather, how to feel it, how to, every piece of leather is different, it's a living thing , and he taught me how the leather talks to you, tells you what it wants to do, or how it's going to come out well. So by then we did a lot of the stuff by hand , like this guy fingering (unintelligible phrase) , a lot of that was done by hand. When you sew two pieces of leather together, they both, both pieces are at a forty five degree angle, and when you sew it together, it's supposed to make a really nice seam. Well, when you last the shoe up and you close it up, part of the vamp, what's called a vamp, the bottom part of the top part is called a plug, but you may have part of the vamp that's going to stretch more than the other part, because it is a living thing, so you have to, you over last it, you look at it and you feel it and everything, and you may have to cut some off this side, or purposely last it a little crooked , but there's things that you need to.do that you 've got to be careful, because leather has a memory. You put it on the last, you sew it up real nice and everything, and if you didn't do it right, you pull it off with a laster, it's called warp, the shoe's going to look awful, and you going say, oh well. So you have to learn how to, to listen to the leather, to what it's telling you, and you can make pairs of shoes that last forever. They're really, and the way that you punch with your awl, pull your stitches together, how closely they are together, the rule of thumb was five stitches to the inch, I mean, depending on what kind of leather that you use and stuff. If I was sewing some exotic alligator hides or something like that, five stitches to the inch, you 'd be playing with fire, because the seam wouldn't be very, very strong . That leather had a tendency to dry up. But gee, I remember back in the early '60s, some shoes were selling for two or three hundred dollars a pair. That was horrendous amount of money for a pair of shoes back then, you know, but they were alligator and crocodile and all kinds of stuff. And then, well I hate to say it this way, but the tree huggers and all them got into that, couldn't kill snakes and lizards anymore to make shoes. But it went through an evolution process, it was basically fairly rough hand sewing when I first started , and then as we got better at what we did, we made more money. And the fact that the shoes were all sold already and there was little competition, they had to pay us well. But it's not somebody that you can take off of the street, put him on a bench and say, sew me fifty pairs of shoes today. First of all, I used to, later on in my career I was a, a trainer for Cole Haan, and (unintelligible phrase) , and we used to train all of the operations in the factory, but mine was more the hand sewing and stuff. And then another person was the making room , another person was the finishing room , and we had (unintelligible word) , and a (unintelligible word) that was the stitching. And the really good success rate of training a person to hand sew and having them stay would be like forty percent, that was really good. It's a really physically demanding job and it takes a tot of discipline. Some think they like it, and some people don't have it. You could teach them for the rest of their lives and they're going to sew crooked seams and make ugly shoes, because they don't see. You have to be able to see in your head , you know, in your mind's eye of what it's supposed to took like. You 4 also have to be the type of person to say, if I'm going to spend fifty bucks on a pair of shoes, I want it to be a good pair of shoes, not just get by. And you have to take some pride in what you 're doing . So you can't just yank somebody off the street. It takes time, it takes weeks. If you get a hand sewer (unintelligible word) trained in ten, twelve weeks, you 're doing well, but you got to pay him while you 're doing it, he's not making you any money, you know, that's the company's viewpoint. So we, Timberland was, back in the middle '60s these people, the guys who worked at Timberland, we were making four hundred or five hundred dollars a week, in the '60s, and we decided that weren 't enough. It came contract time, we said, we're walking out. So we walked out and the guy that owned us, the owner, he says, I can't give you any more money, I'm right at the limit, don't, don't push it. And we said , oh, he's got all kinds of money. We walked out, he put a lock on the door, brought everything to an end, (unintelligible phrase). we were out of a job, and we brought that on ourselves, we really did. It was a good company, they treated us well, and they paid us well. We just got greedy, just got greedy. But it was like working at a circus too. I mean we had, like out of two hundred and twenty five hand sewers, I would bet there was one hundred and fifty of them that were between the ages of eighteen and twenty two. So come Friday afternoons when we got paid, oh my god, the bars and the clubs in town and things, it was a real circus, it was. And not all the guys could get along, you know, we'd see fist fights and all kinds of stuff, right at work. Because it was a really neat period. I used to drink a little back then, well, actually more than I should have. Commonwealth fired me like two or three times, and they'd call me up the next day. I got fired from Commonwealth one time, ten o'clock in the morning, at quarter past ten, I was working at Billings. It was like that."
"AL:","Because of your talent?"
"BC:","Oh, yeah, I had it because of the availability of the job. See, they, they needed hand sewers, everybody needed hand sewers, and it's not something that you, so that, that, you're not going to hire, like I said, off the street, unless you luck out to have some guy that you know. And because I had that drink or two more than I should have on Fridays or whatever, that didn't make any difference to them, they had ninety more guys just like me. Oh, the vultures would come over to the club and get us Friday afternoons. Can you guys please come back to work, please? It was, it was a really neat job because you were like your own boss. I could, all of us, we could go in nine o'clock in the morning , or we could go one in the afternoon, and nobody would say a word, as long as you sewed your, let's say the shops said okay, the minimum we want is twenty four pairs a day, and I could do twenty four pairs in four hours, so once my twenty four pairs were done, if I left, I left, there's nothing they could say, because I'd done what I was supposed to. And when there was a lot, a lot of work, they used to say, come on, try eight hours, it doesn't hurt that much. But we'd be working and say, I had a friend of mine, (unintelligible phrase) dead fisherman, and he'd look out the window and say, it's too nice to work today, and out we go, we'd go fishing for the day. It was like owning your own (unintelligible word). if you did your job, you did it well, and you did what they 5 asked . As the company started putting the screws on the hand sewers and the employees, other employees, because hand sewing was not the only good paying job. Factories were, the shoe industry was good to the city. We had nicer looking cars and toys than the guys that worked at the bank. Oh, we had a parking lot that Commonwealth and Billing and all that were filled up with muscle cars towing stuff. Like one of first cars I, I had a nice car, I bought it, I'd use a Charger, RT six pack, four hundred and ten flat head motor, a six thousand dollar car, but I paid eleven thousand dollars for my house back then. So six thousand dollars for a car was an awful lot of money, but it was (unintelligible word) . But slow but sure, they all left for a variety of reasons. If you get into, like I said , LL Bean's made real, really nice casual shoes, and they were a small company, they were thirty five , forty hand sewers. And the Quaddy Moe was a huge company. Commonwealth I think was the biggest one. Commonwealth Shoe actually was Bostonians, and they branched off from the hand sewing and went to, they tried cordovan type leather and stuff, and artificial, breathable leathers and things, and, and that technology improved . Because I think they had the financial resources to do it, where a lot of companies here were small, smaller, well, they were a large shoe company, but they were started by people right here, like David Rancourt. He started Downeast Casual Footwear, which ended up eventually, ended up Cole Haan, which eventually was bought by Nike for like $130 million. You're talking a long ways for a little guy that, that started off in a shoe shop. George Denny, that owned Commonwealth, that owned the Cole Haan, believe it or not, used to be a cutter at Augusta Shoe. And what happened with those, how that started was back in the 1920s and '30s, there was a company called Cole Haan in Chicago that made a really high end shoe. Now either Mr. Cole or Mr. Haan, one of them kicked the bucket before the other one did , and the other carried on. I believe Mr. Cole died first. Then Mr. Haan carried on until he became too old to do it, or didn't want to do it or whatever, and his family had nothing, they didn't want anything to do with it. So it just died out. They made a really high end product. I mean their shoes were really expensive, well made. So what George did, he did , was he bought the rights to the Cole Haan name for like two thousand dollars. And he used to cut shoes. Now there's an interesting part of my career, I mean, one of the best parts is that George used to cut the leather in the samples, and I used to work at a little shoe shop in Greene, and I worked for Danny Byron and his father, Roger. We were only about fifteen hand sewers. And George used to bring us his samples, and I would sew them, and Keith Hanson and this guy called Skip, Skips Lyons, used to do the finish work on them, and then George would receive and go sell his shoes, but he didn't go to WaiMart or places that he would have never made, he went to Macy's and Saks and things like that and sold really high end calfskin shoes and things like that, nice stuff. And within a matter of fifteen, twenty years, he sold it for $120 million dollars. And I can remember lending George twenty bucks to put his gas in his car to get, to make it to the airport. And he looked so tired all the time. He's such a nice man. I used to tell him, I'd say George, can you pay me before you leave, you look like you're going to die here. He worked really hard, very intelligent man, very, but a nice man. 6 So, and that's how I was part of Downeast for many years, and then Cole Haan for many years, because as they progressed , they brought, I went with them. I'd say I probably sewed, sewed maybe fifty, see, at least fifty percent of all the samples he ever sold . He always treated me well, the company treated us well. They just, when the factories, when the bigger companies started going public and they had investors, then you have to answer to the investors, and the only way to do that is to stay on the black line. A perfect example of that is the Cole Haan factory in Livermore Falls. There's a style of shoe called a (unintelligible word) , a regular man's (unintelligible word) . If a hand sewer in Livermore Falls sewed fifty pairs a day, and there were a few that could, he would make roughly between a hundred and eighty, two hundred dollars a day. So the same shoe, the exact same shoe, we were sewing it when I was down in Mexico working in a factory called Carelli's, there they were sewing Cole Haan shoes, the exact same shoe, if a hand sewer sewed fifty pairs, same quality and everything, he was making about seventy, eighty dollars a week, and up here we were given nine hundred , a thousand for the exact same product. There's no way you can say no to a deal like that because, I hate to admit it, the quality that was coming out of the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, a lot of these places, actually the quality was better than what we were putting out, or equal. And when the quality that was bad is because you were paying four dollars for those shoes. But Brazilians, oh, they made beautiful shoes, Italians. It's hard to compete, at those prices you can't. And then of course, for us, in the shoe industry, took a wicked beating from the environmental protection people. They changed a lot of the tanning, because it was just polluting."
"AL:","(Unintelligible phrase)"
"BC:","No, it's horribly, it's horrible, I mean they're using all kinds of heavy metals and stuff to, to process all of this, like the tanneries. So the Environmental Protection Agency says, you can't use chrome in there anymore, you can't use mercury in that anymore, you can't do this, you can 't do that. So they had to change all the tanning processes, and as they were doing this they made a lot of not so good leather, if you want to put it that way. So the companies, self preservation for LL Bean's and all of these others, they decided to buy their leathers overseas, and before our tanneries caught up and all of that, and even then there's product that we had to let go completely. There was a kind of a leather that was, it was called chrome, then they'd stop, it wore like iron, they had to take it, they, they had to stop it completely. Because the thing was, I guess you could almost use that as one of these mass weapons of mass destruction or whatever, because it was that bad, actually to the point where sometimes it would make the people sick, the people that wore them because it had been lea-, leach into their pores, so it's understandably off of the market. But all of these, it takes years and years and years to develop tanning process, because you don't develop them tomorrow, and they fluctuate so much because of, you may believe it or not, if you buy your hides that come from a bunch of cows from Argentina, or you buy your hides from a bunch of cows in Texas, they're not going to react the same in the tannery. Your cows from Texas will be much easier to, to tan the hides, and you'll 7 come out with a better product, because they're better fed, their environment, there's all kind of stuff. Where they get brush cows from Africa, where they pick them up there when they can barely walk anymore, and then, and then you get leathers don't work well, they don't, like I said , it's, it's a living thing, it talks to you, it reacts to its environment and everything as it's coming along, because it's actually a living part of your product to a certain point, and then somebody (unintelligible word) and skins it, and then it ends up material. But it's, it's an amazing process all the way around. The shoe industry in Lewiston and Auburn, though they was, once again, there was all of these big factories, but there was some really interesting characters in there too."
"AL:","I'd like you to talk about them, if you could."
"BC:","Well, (name) Feinstein, he was, he was an amazing man, and sadly to say, he's, he was Jewish and there was a lot of people back then, and even now (unintelligible phrase) , but there was a lot of people back then that, that were prejudiced , so they didn't like Jewish people. But he owned Arno Moe, which was, it was kind of a, I don't know if you're old enough to remember, but there used to be these little women's moccasins that you'd buy in like the Dollar Store and things like that, they were made out of cowhide and they had like little Indian beads on them. Okay, now ninety nine percent of these moccasins were sewn at home by women. They would stop by the factory, pick up their cases of shoes, and my mother did that for a long time, they'd pick up a case of shoes and bring them home, because by then working mothers, there wasn't that many. Mothers would stay home, feed the kids in the morning, send them off to school, and then she laced her moccasins all day. But what was amazing about Arno Moccasin was he was a prisoner in one of the Nazi camps, he even had the numbers on his arm, he was about that close to being dead for about a good part of his life, and yet he was still good natured, he was a kind man, he really was. One of the guys that we used to work with, his house burned down one time, they had nothing left. There was him and his wife and three kids, and nothing. All they had was his car. He was staying at his mother-in-law's house, and one night, knock, knock on the door, and the door opens, it's Arno and he had an envelope, and he told Roland, he says here, this is for you, if anybody asks you where you got it, don't say a word, he says. So he opened up the envelope, Arno gave him five thousand dollars, just gave it to him. And Roland says, you know, I can't pay this back. He said, I didn't ask you, did I? Which was really, really nice. But he didn't want anybody to know, because he was afraid that they were going to hurt his reputation. And Mr. Koss, oh, he did a couple of things, but he was horrible. He used to go to the factory, now this is a five story factory, he had like eight hundred employees, and he'd stop at a rack and take off his suit coat, and he'd undo his tie, and roll his sleeves up, and pull tacks and do all, oh, he was horrible. And he'd jump right in there with everybody. One time it was so funny, he fired the Coke man . This guy come in and then he was delivering the Coke in the machine, right? And, and after he filled his machine and everything, and he's leaning against, all he had on was at-shirt and jeans. 8 He's leaning against the wall, and he's watching us working. Mr. Koss walks by, looks at him and says, what the hell are you doing? And the guy says, watching . He says, I don't pay you for that, get out of here. So the guy says, cool. So once the guy left, I told Mr. Koss, I says, you know what? He says, what? I says, you just fired the Coke guy. He looks at me, says, I don't want him hanging around my factory anyway. He used to go, he used to go around picking up elastics, and then bitch at everybody that threw the elastics on the floor. And that factory was a golden factory until Mr. Koss got ill and his son Herbie took over. His son Herbie, sadly to say was, his interests were the strippers, the Holly, and horse racing and playing cards, and he burned it, and he gave that factory away at the card table, at the racetrack, eventually it closed . Koss Shoe made a lot of children 's shoes, tons and tons and tons and tons of kids' shoes. They weren't expensive but they were well made. And he was another one, an immigrant from Europe, that came over during the second World War, because they were blowing away his country. And these people had lived hard lives, and they came over here and started growing businesses out of just sweat equity, they didn't have any money. They'd start off with little, tiny shoe factories, then the first thing you know they're (unintelligible word) . So Mr. Koss was really an example, David Rancourt was another one (unintelligible word) . You know this thing about that Frenchman doesn't hold water, not at all. Some of these guys were pretty smart. At Commonwealth Shoe, I think probably the biggest influence on my (unintelligible word) and the other hand sewers was Mr. Bill Salinger. Now he's, oh, maybe in his eighties, and lives in Litchfield on a big old farm . But, can you imagine trying to take care of two hundred and twenty five kids? Actually, that's what we were. The work wasn't really what interested us. Bottom line to ninety percent of the guys was to have enough money to go out and chase women, and drink, and play cards, and have a good time."
"AL:","So it was more like a life style thing?"
"BC:","Oh, completely."
"AL:","Could you talk about that? BC : Completely, like okay, there used to be a guy like, this was a hand sewers week, Monday, I would come in, and a lot of them, ten o'clock or so, and by twelve thirty I was going (unintelligible word) , you know, hard weekend. It wasn't, it wasn't rare to get out of work Friday and not go to bed until Sunday night, you'd party all the time. So Fridays, used to be a little restaurant across the street from the, it was called Cedar Street Lunch. First of all, where the Good Shepherd building is on the corner of Lincoln Street now, okay, there used to be a gentleman that would go there, this was so cool, and he'd have his big briefcase full of money and his bodyguard, and this guy was like six feet nine, must have weighed three hundred pounds, had a big scar, I mean he was scary. But this guy used to cash our paychecks, because you didn't have time to leave the shop for the bank, do all this and all that, and a lot of guys didn't want a bank 9 account. So they didn't want to pay like twenty five dollars or twenty dollars or whatever it was to open an one up and go there and all that, and I mean, just, just cash my check. So this guy used to cash our checks, he'd charge us a buck. So we'd go and, and he'd cash a lot of checks, so we'd go and cash our check, give him his dollar, and then go to Cedar Street Lunch and have something, fried clams or something, and a couple of beers. And then inevitably we'd end up, there was the Hotel Holly, there was the Royal Hotel, the Holly had the sleaziest dancers you have ever seen in your life. And then one of the prerequisites for a girl to dance there was she had to be fat and ugly, and we went anyway. There was the Hotel Royal, and then there was all the clubs."
"AL:","The social clubs?"
"BC:","Along lower Lisbon Street and on Lincoln Street, there used to be, where the fire station is on Lincoln Street now, right across the street there used to be a bar joint called Little, Little Tiny's, and then there was the Hurricane Club, and the Lewiston Social, and of course there was the Manoir, the sleaziest bar in the state of Maine. There, every, every tough guy -."
"AL:","What was it called?"
"BC:","The Manoir. Every tough guy in the state of Maine would go to the Manoir just to prove how tough he was. There were fights there all the time, but it was a really neat place to pick up girls. And girls used to come from all over, I'd say from all over, girls would come from Turner and Hartford and (name) and all of that and everything, because you had a lot of young men with a lot of money. These, these guys were all beer drinking and dancing and having a good time, got a couple, three hundred dollars in their pocket."
"AL:","And was the South End Club there (unintelligible word)?"
"BC:","Oh yeah, the South End Club was there, but there was a lot of places there that don't exist anymore. There was like Gary's Tavern, and there was Lucky's, all of these little bars and stuff. Simone's Hot Dog Stand was always full of hand sewers, because George was, was a really neat guy, George Simone."
"AL:","Yeah, he was."
"BC:","Oh yeah, and he took care of a lot of us, he really did, because sometimes some of the kids would get to drinking more than they should and their world would fall apart, and they needed a hand. Babe Melanson, in the Manoir, I don't know how many paid, how many, his mother used to run the hotel part, I don't know how many young men she'd let stay, give them a room for a week or two and not even charge them. It was like that back then. There was 7-Eleven Pool, that used to have a lot of hand sewers. There used to be hand sewers that get out of work at night, no weekends, they'd go 10 over to 7-Eleven Pool and start these games of nine ball, where you could really make a lot of money, or lose a lot of money. And these games would start like Friday afternoon at twelve, one o'clock, and last until Monday morning, and when one guy go broke, another guy would jump in. But then , in card games, Lewiston Social, I've seen card games where these guys would be betting a thousand dollars and things like that. So it was a really interesting time of life, because what a lot of people don't understand about the shoe industry, it's not just the shoe industry that it was, it was important, but the shoe industry made the city of Lewiston. For every hand sewer there was, there was at least six or seven people that worked in affiliated businesses. You'd take like, you got stitching at Commonwealth Shoe that has two hundred machines, you need somebody to take care of those two hundred machines. You need someplace to buy the parts. You need someplace to buy some new ones. You need the people that supply you the thread. You need the people, you know, it just goes on and on and on and on . You have, like let's say Lounge Shoe, okay? They made women's high heels and things like that. And then you had Maine Heel that made the heels for Lounge Shoe, and then you had Maine Stamping that cut the leather and everything and assembled the heels for Maine Heel that sold to Lounge Shoe that, and it just kept going on and on and on like that. So for every shoe shop job there was, there was maybe five other jobs out there that were depending on this. And that is what really hurt cities of Lewiston and Auburn was the global effect. You know, you can say okay, we just laid off two hundred hand sewers, the factory's closed , you lost two hundred jobs. You didn't lose two hundred jobs, you lost six, eight hundred jobs. That's, that's like, I've got some people that you need to meet and to talk to that's going to be really interesting for you. Because you take like a Morris Cote, he's been in the shoe industry since like the '50s, early '60s, but in the supply part, sewing machines, equipment, hand sewing tools, everything, and that's a person that you would need to talk to. Other people, Dick (name) was a hand sewer, probably one of the fastest hand sewers that ever lived, he was the Wayne Gretzky of hand sewing. There was ten thousand hand sewers, and everybody knew who he was, and right, and now he's a very, very wealthy man that runs a big business. He'll be able to let you in. He, he's going to be able to take you from being a lowly hand sewer to how hand sewing allowed him to be where he is now."
"AL:","And what's his name?"
"BC:","Dick (name) , his name's actually Frenchie, and he owns Modern Woodsmen."
"AL:","Yes, okay."
"BC:","Here in town, and they're what? Eight, ten financial advisors, and a million dollar business. And other people, like David Rancourt is someone that you really need to meet. The people, like Edmund Allen, now he hung on the longest though. You say how the shoe industry here, how it impacted here, there used to be eighteen hundred shoe factories in the United States. With the closing of this one, there's thirty four left. 11 Now if you take ten of those eighteen hundred, figure a certain average of employees, and multiply that times six or seven, you know how many people lost their jobs in the market in general, and in the business itself. It's unbelievable, it's just really a sad thing, because hand sewn shoes are the best made shoes in the world. If they're sewed right , they'll outlast any other product that you put on the market. But as far as here goes, here in Lewiston, I can say Commonwealth was owned by Bostonian, which was eventually one of the General Dynamics companies, which is big , okay? There was Timberland, which is also very big . But you had companies, I mean (unintelligible word) companies here in town, like Knapp Shoe. Knapp Shoe made the best workboots in the world , and it was a huge factory, and eventually they just lost to foreign competition. I kind of hate to put it all on foreign competition, because it's an easy out, it really is. You have to sometimes look in the mirror and say, hey look, it's my fault, it- really is. The state of Maine in general was very hostile to the shoe industry."
"AL:","In what ways?"
"BC:","Not, not, not intentionally, okay? Electricity, why couldn't, why couldn 't the state of Maine say, okay, shoe factories, you charge them so much and that's it? But they're paying the highest power rates in the country, they're paying the highest heating rates in the country. Everything is more expensive here in Maine to begin with . If they would have given these people a break, that's what I never understood, see, they had existing factories that were working well and didn't give them a hand, and yet they want to bring in a new, new company, and they give them tax breaks and subsidies and things like that. It seems to me like they bit the hand the fed , that fed them. My grandfather used to say, if you don't want to get hit by a car, don't lay down in the road . That's basically what they did is, is they let themselves get hit."
"AL:","I'm going to pause right there and flip the tape over. End of Side A Side 8"
"AL:","We are now on side B of the interview of Barney Charest, and the date is still April4, 2007, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. And Barney, we were talking during the break about what we're going to talk about next, and sort of take it from your perspective, where you started and where you went throughout the years, so take it away."
"BC:","Oh, it's going to be a cool trip. Like I said, I learned how to hand sew at, from Dave Rancourt, in the little shop on the loading dock at Koss Shoe is where I started . There was an ad in the newspaper, Commonwealth was looking for hand sewers, so I went there and applied for a job and got hired, where I got adopted by a guy named, Dick McBride and another guy named Marcel Grondin, where they thought that my natural ability was rare. And the fact is, they said I was very good. And I think, maybe for their own ego or to really help me out is always been a question for me, I think that 12 they felt that if they could be involved in teaching somebody that they thought could really go somewhere, was important to them in their careers. But they both did an excellent job, they were both really nice men. And I worked for, I was working for Commonwealth, I worked for them for, let's see, about three and half, four years. And in that time I went from regular hand sewer to a sample sewer, where most of my job for the whole day was just product development, sewing new shoes and things like that. And then I came home one day, had a letter from the Department of the Army to get drafted , and I ended up, I spent a little over two years in the army."
"AL:","What years were those?"
"BC:","Sixty eight, '69. I did, actually, almost two tours of duty in Vietnam. Then when I came home, I went to work for a little factory in Bowdoinham, called Sir-Gal. We were only about twenty hand sewers or so, and I'd been out of hand sewing for awhile, and they hired me the day I applied for the job, I sewed a couple of shoes, they said, you 're in , start today if you want."
"AL:","How do you spell Sir-Gal?"
"BC:","It was S-1-R dash G-A-L. The main product for them was boat shoes, and that"
