"AL:","Did he talk about the old days when he first started, how the mill was different?"
"RF:","No, because in the summer time he was a carpenter, see, and in winter time he was working, that was his first winter that he got the job there, so I got the job, too, you know."
"AL:","What were some, or who were some of the people that you remember from your time at the mill? Anyone maybe that we can’t talk to that you remember?"
"RF:","Well, I do remember, but a lot of it, they, as you said, they’re all dead."
"AL:","Yeah, and so it’s important to talk about them, it’s the only way to capture who they were, and their jobs. 4"

"RF:","Yes, WWII, yes, yes."
"RD:","Was there anything different that happened in the mills during the war?"
"RF:","Well, they didn’t want to give us a raise. It was wartime. When the war finish, the CIO, they rub up the buck, they wanted a raise, you know. So we picket, you know, that was my fun, I was young, and we used to go to the Jacques Cartier Hall, yeah, that’s where the office of the CIO was."
"RD:","Oh, I didn’t realize that, yeah."

"AL:","Right, and how was that strike resolved, do you remember?"
"RF:","Well, we won the case, of course. We were working almost for nothing, but minimum, you know, we were happy, and then we got the strike. Oh yeah, I think we strike about a month."
"RD:","How did people survive during the strike, because you weren’t making any money, how -?"
"RF:","The CIO was helping them."
"RD:","The CIO helped the people survive."
"RF:","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not the single men, but the family one."
"RD:","The families. So the single men didn’t get any help."
"RF:","No, no, well I was working part time, you know, no problem. No problem. At that time, see, we had the St. Mary’s, we had the St., the Cadet of St. Mary’s. Remember the St. Mary’s Cadet? So we have a skating rink, and we used to make ice at two o’clock in the morning, after the public skating."
"RD:","So you kept busy that way."
"RF:","Yeah, we didn’t pay a cent to skate, so."
"RD:","So you did okay."
"RF:","Yes, yes."
"RD:","Good. Now the trains I know go by on Lincoln, used to go by in back of Lincoln Street. Did you ever play around the train tracks and stuff?"
"RF:","Oh, once in a while, yes, once in a while we used to play, but."
"RD:","Wasn’t it a good train for the hobos, do you remember that?"
"RF:","Say that again?"

"AL:","Or earlier, during the Depression?"
"RD:","Well, I remember it, playing, and my parents used to, I used to go with Maurice Dutil."
"RF:","Yeah, Maurice."
"RD:","Maurice, we used to go because the hobos would come off the train and there was a space there that they would build their fire. And we’d go sit with them and listen to their stories. But that was when -"
"RF:","It must have been after."
"RD:","That was in the fifties, mid fifties."
"RF:","Because Maurice is younger than me, much younger than me."
"RD:","Yeah, that’s right, yeah, so it must have been, that must have been -"
"RF:","Roger, and he was at the Marcotte Home."
"RD:","So you didn’t have anything like that, so the trains didn’t really affect your lives, no."
"RF:","No, no, no."
"RD:","Okay."
"AL:","Do you remember Fred Lebel?"
"RF:","Yeah, Fred, yeah, he used to live on Cedar Street, that big block there, before crossing the bridge. Now he’s making bedspread."

"RF:","Well, it was a snowshoe club."

"RD:","And I see you there sometimes, so."
"RF:","And it’s a beautiful club. They meet, and there’s no -"

"RD:","What, the Montagnard is different?"
"RF:","Oh yeah. Now there’s no more, but it was, you know, dirty. 8"
"AL:","But what is a snowshoe club, what does it do?"
"RF:","Well, they meet, they meet together. If there’s the snowshoe convention, they meet together, and they go to clubs, to one club to another and they talk, and they have a few drinks. And there’s some run on snowshoes."

"RD:","Oh yeah, it’s a big thing today."
"RF:","That’s, at Lee they got the insurance, so that’s the main thing. Because she liked the job for Bob, oh yeah, she was the first one."
"RD:","Was there a difference between the women working in the mills and the men? Were there certain jobs that were just for the women, that you noticed? Or did anybody do anything? Did the women have a harder time to get hired than the men?"
"RF:","No. And women could, my job, a woman was making my job (unintelligible phrase)."
"RD:","Yeah? So there wasn’t much difference."
"RF:","There wasn’t much different. And during the wartime, we used to doff, you know, doffers? I did that."
"RD:","Oh, you did that."
"RF:","On, just on Sunday, because double time and a half, eh? Because the, that was not my job, but I knew, you know, I had so many hours that I was doing anything. So really -"
"AL:","Do you remember the hockey team?"
"RF:","Yeah, the hockey team (unintelligible word)?"
"AL:","Yeah, well what do you remember about the hockey team? Did you watch any of the games, or participate?"
"RF:","Well, to be truthful, it was who you know. You know, I used to play hockey, and they went oversea and (unintelligible phrase) it was Larry Charest’s brother-in-law. So, at that time it took a lot of money for food, so I didn’t go, you know. But I remember the hockey team, I remember they went oversea and they lost every game but they had a ball."

"RF:","Yes, they had a picnic, yeah. Oh yeah, I remember -"
"RD:","We have a picture of 1937, I believe, that’s, it’s a big picture of the mill picnic, and we’re trying to figure out where it was held."
"RF:","Are you talking about the -"
"RD:","Nineteen thirty-seven, that’s earlier than you."
"RF:","Are we talking the Bates Mill picnic, or the union?"
"RD:","The Bates Mill."
"RF:","The Bates Mill."
"RD:","You’re talking about, the union picnic used to be at, okay, so they were different."
"RF:","Yeah, all, there was, well, all the one that was in the union they were giving free beer, free drink, food and so on, that was a big picnic."
"RD:","That was the union picnic."
"RF:","Yeah."
"RD:","And then the mills gave one, too, right?"
"RF:","That I’m not sure."
"AL:","I’m wondering if they’re one and the same. It sounds like the description of the mill picnic. That would be interesting to find out."
"RF:","That I don’t remember."
"RD:","Did you miss the mills when you left it?"
"RF:","Well, yes, but when I left the mill I went to work for myself, you know. So, when you stop, you don’t have much of that. So I put in a long, long hours, but I made good, did good. And I didn’t think too much of the Bates Mill because I was too busy, too 14 busy."
"AL:","If you think back about your time working in the mill, what sticks out in your mind as things that you liked about it?"
"RF:","What I like about it? The people."
"AL:","The people."
"RF:","The people. Yeah, we were talking and, you know, yeah."
"AL:","It was a friendly atmosphere?"
"RF:","A friendly atmosphere. Those were the golden days."
"RD:","Yeah, that’s what, when we had the reunion, that seemed to be what the people felt, too, that those were the golden days."
"RF:","Now, well, now today, you don’t dare to talk to the one that lives at the first floor. You, you know, it’s different."
"RD:","What about when you were living here in Little Canada? My uncle told me that sometimes on the weekends, the people would go outside and they’d play their violins, or they’d get together and have a good time. Do you remember any of that?"
"RF:","No, really, on, I used to live on Lincoln Street at that time."
"RD:","Yeah, so, okay, that’s different, yeah."
"RF:","But the neighbors, we used to talk to each other, you know, everybody was friendly. And I remember when I was going to school, there was one woman, she was making, baking a cake and she needed a bowl of sugar, you know. And she said to, she lived on the second or the third floor, that I don’t remember. Anyway, I need a cup of sugar. I look, and gave her a cup of sugar. See, it proves that people really helped each other. You don’t, you can’t do that today."
"RD:","Yeah, big change."
"RF:","A big change, a big change."
"RD:","That really bothers you, doesn’t it, because you’re not used to that, right? You’re always used to helping each other."
"RF:","That’s right. Then, you know, my whole life I used to bring some wood for four 15 old maid, in back. I was getting a quarter a week. And my mother said, you help these people, she said, you don’t need any money, she said. And I got a cut at fifteen cents, so I was working for a dime a week."
"RD:","But that’s how good hearted your mom was."
"RF:","Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, she was very good hearted."
"RD:","But see, that’s why she taught you that helping others is important in life, right?"
"RF:","Yeah, yeah, and now she’s -"
"RD:","Can I ask a, after the war was there a big change when the soldiers that worked at the mills came back, did they come back different?"
"RF:","Well, I remember one. He was shell-shocked. And there was a woman called, her name was Cecile, that was her first name, and once in a while he used to take her arm and bite her. He was shell-shocked; there was quite a few like that."
"AL:","Did some people lose their jobs when the soldiers came back? Did the soldiers get their jobs back?"
"RF:","Yeah, I guess they got their job, but I don’t know, I don’t know that. In my department was mostly women, you know, so really in other department I really don’t know."
"AL:","Is there anything that I haven’t asked you that sticks out in your mind as important to add to the interview today?"
"RF:","I’m not following you."
"AL:","Okay, I’m asking if there’s anything that I haven’t asked you that you want to talk about regarding the mills, or your family?"
"RF:","Well, you covered it all."
"RD:","Monsieur Fournier, how about, like how did religion work in the families? Was it important to the families, like the parishes, the connection with the parishes and stuff? Was that strong?"
"RF:","I’m sorry, you -"
"RD:","Okay, the parishes, St. Mary’s parish, was that important in people’s lives? 16"
"RF:","Yes, (French phrase), Pomerleau. He was very, he used to pay, once a week we used to go swimming at the Y, between certain hours, let’s say between one and three, but we were young, eh, hey, we went to the Y for nothing, he used to pay. He was a good, a good priest, a very good priest. And so was the others, but I mean that’s, that I remember."
"RD:","So it was important for people to go to church on Sunday?"
"RF:","Oh yes, yeah, yeah, yes, yes."
"RD:","And did the church have activities that you participated in, too, also, or?"
"RF:","Well, no, no, I was too young, you know, to participate. But j’etais dans la (unintelligible word) Sacre Cœur."
"RD:","You did belong to (unintelligible word) Sacre Cœur."
"RF:","Yes, because I was, because I was tall I was holding the, I don’t how to say it in English, la bannière."
"RD:","La bannière, yeah."
"RF:","Because I was tall, you know."
"RD:","Yeah, the flag, the -"
"RF:","And there used to be a retreat, a retreat, you know, just for men, and they would have a retreat for women."
"RD:","Oh, they didn’t go together."
"RF:","No, they didn’t go together."
"RD:","So there was a retreat for each."
"RF:","We were men and boys, you know, and the same thing with women and girls."
"RD:","And it was full, people went."
"RF:","Yeah."
"RD:","That’s changed a little today, isn’t it. Yeah. That’s a big change, because today the churches, even the churches on Sunday are not full. 17"
