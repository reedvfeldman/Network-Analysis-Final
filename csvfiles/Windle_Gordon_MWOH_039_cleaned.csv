"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) April 10, 2006 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Mill Workers Oral History Project. Today I’m interviewing Gordon Windle at his home in Auburn, Maine. This is Andrea L’Hommedieu, and the date is April 10th, 2006. Could I start just by asking you to say your full name? Gordon Windle: Gordon Vernon Windle."
"AL:","And what’s your date of birth?"
"GW:","August 25th, 1915."
"AL:","And where were you born?"
"GW:","I was born on 93 Shawmut Street, Lewiston, Maine."
"AL:","Is that where you grew up?"
"GW:","No, second floor, front bedroom. The reason I was born there is I wanted to be near my mother. And we moved to Auburn in 1917, and I’ve lived in Auburn ever since. And just about all of my life, I’ve lived Ward One. This side of the street is Ward One. If I lived on that side of the street, it would be Ward Two."
"AL:","So what was it like growing up in Auburn during those years, especially during the Depression?"
"GW:","I love it. In other words, I can’t tell you too much about Pettingill Park. I was, I could call it born and brought up at Pettingill Park. Every kid in the neighborhood, we had four seasons there, spring, summer, fall, winter, there was something going on all the time. And we had a camp in what they call Saddleback, which was in the middle of Pettingill Park, and we called that the Robin Hood Club, and we used to use bows and arrows as little kids. So up until the time we went to high school, and even after we went to high school, we used Pettingill Park. And if anyone says they don’t have anything to do in my day, all they had to do was go down to Pettingill Park and there was something going on, whether it was baseball, football, skiing, skating, hockey, whatever, all during those early years. And on one side of Pettingill Park there were two shacks, one for boys and one for girls, which they heated with wood. Now, the wood was furnished by the city, as they cut down trees in the area they would bring it up and wood fires going all the time. Now, the Pettingill Park was lighted at night until nine o’clock, and there were strings of lights that went across the water part of Pettingill Park. And they closed at nine o’clock. When they blinked the lights, we went home. They didn’t want people hanging around raising Cain after nine o’clock. I remember the fellow that ran the Pettingill Park and had the ice cleared and all, his name was Bill Graham, and he had a German Shepherd dog that he always brought with him, so we, Bill became part of us. And the name Pettingill came from a man who donated the land at Pettingill Park, his name 1 was Pettingill and he lived right at the entrance to Pettingill Park, on Winter Street, Auburn. And that was his cow pasture, where Pettingill Park is. Probably it comprises fifteen acres or something like that. But it had a stream running through it, which was dammed. And the reason for the dam was to hold back water for Penley’s Slaughterhouse, and two or three businesses downtown. They could open the sluices and the dam and let water go downtown, wherever they needed it for power, or even for water, it was good clean water. And so as a young man and a child, it was the most wonderful thing there could be. And on Sundays, we had electric cars in those days. And when I say electric cars, I don’t mean an electric automobile. I mean trolley, electric trolley cars, used to come with loads of people from Lewiston, Auburn, everywhere, only cost ten cents to get over to Denison Street, Auburn, where the car ended and left people there to go down to Pettingill Park. And on a Sunday, there could be a hundred and fifty, two hundred people skating around Pettingill Park. In the winter of course. And in the summer we had baseball leagues, and primary school, grammar school, mostly in the lower grades. High school was played over at AAA Park, Triple A Park in Auburn. So I can’t say too much about how nice Auburn was to have a park named Pettingill Park, which operated four seasons, the year round there was something going on. What was the other thing I wanted to tell you? Oh, I went to school. First, my whole family, there were three children in our family. I have a brother that was older, I have a sister, and myself. We went to Washburn School first, from grade one to grade six. And then we went to Webster Grammar School, grade six to grade nine. Then we went to Edward Little, all three of us kids went to those three schools. And I’m talking about the old Edward Little on Main Street, Auburn. And my, we had a little hard luck in the family, so my brother quit school when he was a sophomore in high school and went to work at a summer resort, and probably earned all of twelve dollars a week. And my sister and I continued on through high school, she graduated in 1931 and I graduated in 1933. In my grammar school life, I met the love of my life, down at Webster Grammar School, and her name was Margaret Edna Cronk, spelled C-R-O-N-K. I fell in love with her when I was fourteen years old, and we went together, became married, raised a family. Sixty-five years later, I lost my wife, the love of my life. We had had three children, and we were married for fifty-seven years. So in my family we had almost everybody, not many divorces, but all of us, my brother and sister and I all had been married over fifty years. My father and mother had been married over fifty years. So we have a pretty good record of no divorces. There might have been fights, but not any divorces."
"AL:","And can you, I was going to change subjects. Did you have something else to add to what you were saying just now?"
"GW:","Yeah, in the summer time our neighborhood, we called it Perryville, and it’s still called Perryville, alongside of Pettingill Park, and it ran over to Winter Street, Summer Street, Turner Street, Whitney Street, we called Perryville. And in the summer, the White family of Turner Street, of White Home Farms, allowed us to go in their woods up on, between Summer Street and Turner Street, and we could go in there and build fires, cut down trees, take home Christmas trees, and build camps and all that. The White family allowed us to do that. And out in that area there was a big cliff, and we could build fires at the bottom of that cliff, and at the top of the cliff there was a shelf of rocks, you could crawl under that, which was kind of a daring thing. And in the winter we slid with our sleds and double runners on what we call Long Hill, and Long Hill started up near Mt. Auburn Cemetery, and ended down near the headwaters of the brook running through 2 Pettingill Park. I think the real name of that brook was called Bog Brook. And we could go and, and Christmas time we could go up there in the woods and, we called it the Green Woods, that was the name of it, and we always got a tree that didn’t quite fit in our home. It was too tall, or too short, or one sided, so we would end up normally buying a Christmas tree from the vendor. We hung around a store on Summer Street, it was called Wag’s Market, and it was an IGA store, and we used to sit on the steps and talk and all that. And in doing that, if we made too much noise the owners of the store would come out and tell us to go home. And while I was a young man, my father had me mow our lawn, shovel our own snow, along with my brother. And one day in the early spring, my father announced to me, Gordon, you’re going to start mowing Mrs. Loring’s lawn tomorrow. And I was probably all of ten or twelve years old, and I started mowing lawns at that time, and probably got as much as thirty five cents an hour for mowing lawns. In the winter same thing, I shoveled snow. After I mowed the lawn once or shoveled snow and established a price, that’s what I charged for the rest of the summer or the winter. And I became a professional snow shoveler and lawn mower, and I did all of the lawns in the neighborhood, I could name probably as many as eight or ten different family lawns. The one that we stayed with the longest was owned by George C. Weber, a well known local attorney, he lived in the next house to us. And we ran a bill with him, so when the bill got up we’ll say to ten or twelve dollars, we would tell them how much they owed us and he would send us a check. But we always did his shoveling first thing in the morning when we got up, before school, because he had a reo car that he had in his garage, and he wanted to get to work every day. So we would, my brother and I would go shovel, he had a driveway running to his garage, and he had two or three minor walkways to his home, and we did all of that before we went to school each day, when there was a storm. And we ran a bill and he paid us whenever we sent him a bill. And we did that for, I’m going to say all ten, fifteen years of our young childhood and boyhood and manhood. And my sister even helped do some of these things in her life time. My brother was three years older than I am, he was born in 1912. My sister is fourteen months older than I am, and she was born in 1914. And I was born in 1915. My sister is still a survivor. She lives in Honolulu, Hawaii right now, and she’s ninety one years old, and her husband is ninety one years old, and they’re still active, and I hope they live to be a hundred. The oldest one in my family that I’ve ever known of, the name Windle is English, and my grandfather Windle came from England, and his brother, his name is Asa, A-S-A, came from England earlier than my grandfather, and my uncle Asa lived to be ninety nine years old. That is the oldest member on either side of our family that I know of. And Uncle Asa had held the Post cane for Lisbon, and he was the oldest resident of Lisbon and he died at age ninety-nine. I think he died at his son’s home in Brockton, Mass., but we always went to visit my Uncle Asa, he lived across from the old high school in Lisbon for many, many years, and he farmed and worked in the mills. And I think that’s why my grandfather came from England, to live with his brother. Because I guess they told him over in England, the streets of Lewiston, Maine were lined with gold. But he came over and worked in the mills, that’s where I got my early education, so to speak, of Lewiston mills."
"AL:","Do you know what he did in the mill?"
"GW:","Yeah."
"AL:","What did he do?"
"GW:","Well, most of the, of my family were weavers, they call them weavers. But I can talk more about the Lewiston Bleachery and Dye Works, which was owned by the Pepperell Manufacturing Company. 3 And the reason that I went to work there, and it was during the Depression, I remember when I got out of high school in 1933, in June, I went over to the Bleachery and tried to get a job. This is during the Depression, there wasn’t much work. We went up to the second floor in the Bleachery, which was called the colored finishing room, and the superintendent used to come walking in every morning, and there’d be as many as fifty people lined up there waiting to see if they could get a job. So I went there one or two days, and every now and then he’d pick out somebody and give them a job. But I wasn’t successful, so I knew somebody else that worked in the mill, in the Bleachery, and I said to him, what should I do now? And he said, don’t you live near the superintendent of the Bleachery? And I said, yes, why? And he said, go to his house some night, ring the doorbell or rap at the door and introduce yourself, and tell him you’re looking for a job. So I did just that. And his name was Edwin Adams, and he did live right around the corner from I lived. He lived on Vernon Street, Auburn, and I lived on Whitney Street, Auburn. So when I rang the bell, he came to the door and I said, my name is Gordon Windle, and I’m looking for a job. And he said, do you have a grandfather named Harry Windle? I said, yeah. He said, he works in the Bleachery. And he said, I’ll tell you what you do, you come over tomorrow morning and stand in that line, and I will pick you out and I will give you a job. So I did just that, the next day I went and marched in with all those others looking for work. And a year or so before, I must tell you that my grandfather passed away so he no longer worked in the Bleachery, but he had worked there, like, thirty five years, back when they got four dollars a week or something like that. So I went to work in the colored finishing room, first job I had, and my boss’s name was Harry Walker, who lived on Center Street, Auburn, so I, he was a neighbor of ours and I got to know him, had a decent job. I brought in work for the men that were inspecting flannel goods. And after a while, to better my earnings, they put me on as an inspector on one of the machines that inspected the cloth. We cut the seams out, and any damage or stains or anything. And those rolls there were cut ups, what they called a swatch on the end of the cloth, and under those swatch, even if the material went through the same dye, from seam to seam could be a little different color. So we had bosses that would hold the swatches up to the light to match the colors of the flannel. And we had both single nap and double nap. Single nap had, you might call it soft goods on one side, and smooth on the other, like the normal threads would be. And most everything that I remember was light brown. There was some gray goods that went through. Some of the gray goods that went through was called casket material. In other words, casket material was used to cover, I would have to say low price caskets. All of our goods, when it came to the Pepperell Manufacturing Company was gray goods, it was already manufactured but it had no color, hadn’t been bleached. So when it came to the Lewiston Pepperell Manufacturing Company, they had to bleach the goods, and then run it, all of the goods through various machines to color, which would dye there, the dye house. They had bleach houses, and they had steam vats where they used to soak the gray goods before dying it and finishing it. So when the material come in to the Bleachery, it was called gray goods. When it left it was finished goods. Now, Pepperell Manufacturing Company was noted for sheets and pillowcases, so in other words I worked in three different departments, from 1933 to 1941. The first department I worked in was the colored finishing room. The second department I worked in was called rayon finishing room. That was unusual, to have rayon goods, but we had a whole department doing rayon goods which came to us already woven and we dyed it and stretched it to its proper width, and cut out the seams and they had machinery that pressed the goods to make a smooth finish on the rayon. The rayon, I’m not absolutely sure what it was used for. Some of it was manufactured across the street in the Androscoggin Mill, and some of it came to us from, Pepperell had a mill down in Biddeford, and some of the goods came from there. 4 The third place that I worked in the Bleachery was the sheet factory. Now, as I told you before, the Pepperell Manufacturing Company was well known for sheets and pillowcases. So in the sheet department, the girls there stitched the borders on the pillowcases, and the ends and so forth, to make a finished sheet or pillowcase. Now, all day long, I worked there for a few years, and you could hear those sewing machines going, probably fifty to a hundred machines all at once, and they were hustling to make sheets and pillowcases. And one of the jobs I had there, we called it tearing sheets. The sheets came to us in rolls, and we nicked them on a little table with a knife, and then you tore them apart so that they would become, they were various lengths, ninety inches, ninety nine, a hundred and eight, and threw it down to the other end and a girl would fold those, and then from them they were taken to the girls that stitched them and made sheets and pillow cases, whichever one you were doing. The first job I had in the sheet factory was to bring the work in to the men that tore sheets, or sheet tearing department. I finally worked into that job. And every job made us a little more money. I want to talk about what I earned in the Bleachery. The first job I had in the colored finishing room, I worked I think either two or three weeks before the NRA, National Recovery Act, and at that time we could work fifty-four hours. And we worked five and a half days, it was a half a day on Saturday. And I think my pay for fifty-four hours for that two or three weeks I worked was like eighteen dollars and a half. And I do recall that when they went on forty hours, which was soon after, and they cut the pay to seventeen dollars a week, men that had been working seventy-two hours for twenty two dollars were mad. Imagine the less work and the hours they put in, but they were made because they got less pay, five dollars a week less pay or something like that. So then we went on forty-hour work weeks, and we had normally in the Bleachery, in various parts, we had three shifts. The day shift was from quarter of seven in the morning til quarter of three in the afternoon. Second shift was quarter of three in the afternoon til quarter of eleven at night. And the third shift was from quarter of eleven at night til quarter of seven in the morning. Now, we ate on the job usually, whatever we did, we brought our own meals, a brown bag lunch usually, and we’d eat on the job. If you had a noon hour, which some departments had, we could leave the mill and go up on Lisbon Street, and that’s another remark I want to make, that a meal, a full course meal during the Depression, on Lisbon Street, was twenty-five cents. That included soup, your main course, coffee, all of the food that went with your main course and a piece of pie for dessert, all twenty-five cents. And when that all ended, we’ll say five years later, they went up to thirty-five cents. We thought that was a tremendous jump, because at thirty-five cents, that was a lot of money to us. But I remember that when we first got paid in the Bleachery, I think we got paid on Thursday, and they held one week pay back, and you got paid every Thursday, and they gave us our pay in cash, in an envelope with our name on it. So here we lined up, over a thousand employees if they were all there, and went through the line and they, your name was on your own envelope and you’d receive that, and then you went back to work. I do recall that many housewives were waiting outside the gate, so that when their husband got his pay, they came to the gate and passed their pay to their wife, so they would get with most of their pay. I do recall that during the time that I worked in the Bleachery, Prohibition ended, and they had three-two beer, 3 point 2 beer, and a lot of the people that worked with me used to eat their lunch during their working hours, and go out at noon time and drink 3.2 beer uptown. Now, they didn’t come back intoxicated, but they were waiting for that period when they could go and drink 3.2 beer, and come back to work, and there was no charge, no, no, they didn’t come back drunk or anything like that. There was no smoking in the mill, but if you went by a men’s toilet you could smell cigarette 5 smoke. They went in the toilet to smoke. And of course, even when the bosses went by they knew what was happening, but they didn’t make anything of it. And when we worked down in the rayon department, the dye house was next door to us. And in the dye house they had like tubs of water and dye that they ran the gray goods through for color. And in those, in those, in the dye house they dyed flannels, of course sheeting didn’t need dying there, sheeting all needed bleaching so that was another operation. But when you went by where they were dying cloth, they sometimes had acid in the dye to bleach the goods. And I remember some went on one of my feet one time, and I had on just regular shoes, and it went right through my stocking and my shoe and burned my foot. And then I had to go down to the office where the foremen were and ask, what do I do now? And they told me what to do, and I guess I went upstairs. We had a nurse in attendance all the time in the Bleachery, and a doctor come in once a week, and if you had a problem you went to the doctor up there. The doctor’s name was Dr. Haskell, I remember him. The nurse, that was her regular job. She was up on the end of the colored finishing room, and if you had any problem you went to her. When I was working down in the rayon department one day, a man was unfolding the edges of his cloth in his dye mixture, and his arm got run into the cloth roll and tore his arm off. His arm was torn off at the shoulder, and the man was wide awake, and all he did was, his arm was still swinging around in the dye, in the mixer, he ran upstairs to the nurse’s quarters, holding on that, and he didn’t bleed to death, hardly any blood, because when it twisted his arm off it sealed the artery or veins in his shoulder. And they always gave him a job after, but he didn’t lose his, arm and they had to go down and unwind the cloth and take his arm out of there. And I remember that man was quite a bowler, he used to bowl on bowling teams, and the Bleachery had a team. So probably after, he still bowled but with the other hand maybe. The machines were quite dangerous, I would say. If they had had an OSHA in those days, they would have made the company change lots of machines. There were things that were turning all the time, and if you went by and happened to catch your clothing, it would pull you in the machine, and clothing and everything in, and you had to quickly shut it off if you could, or somebody else did. There were things, you could lose fingers. I remember one time I had a job for part of a week. My job was not busy, so they gave me a job where they were running cloth through sulphuric acid mix. And I said, am I going to run this machine? They said, yes. So they taught me how to stitch the ends from one seam to another on a sewing machine, and you had to go fast so this machine is running all the time you’re stitching. And I remember I shut the machine off, and you wasn’t supposed to shut it off in acid. And when the boss came by and saw I was shut down, he said, what did you shut that off for? I said, I ain’t going to dip into that acid there, and run my sewing machine, another machine. And he said, well, what do you want to do? And I said, I’m going to quit. So I quit that job. So this was only part time. And I recall a boy, we were all young, that took my place, lost a finger within days from the time I, he run it between the rolls. The other thing about the men in the dye house, they all had rubber shoes, heavy rubber shoes. They used to wrap their feet in rags, cloth, which there was plenty of them around, and put on their rubber shoes because the floors are always wet. And some places there was an inch or so of water, so they waded through that. And most all the machines were slopping acid, dye and everything, so they had these shoes. The company issued the shoes, you put them on every day if you work in a dye house. I only worked there until I quit that job, because of running through sulphuric acid. Then they gave me a job in the sheet factory, because I had worked there so many years I got a job in the sheet factory. And I remember I had a little office job, stamping tags I think they called it. The men had to have tags for so many dozen sheets or pillowcases, and that was my job, to stamp them and pass them out to 6 the men. And I got twelve dollars straight pay. That was a salary. In other words, that was my salary, twelve dollars. Now, in this day and age you can scoff at that pay, but I remember going to the bank with my first paychecks for seventeen dollars. We got actually sixteen dollars and ninety cents. Ten cents a week was for insurance. But I remember the men working in the bank, behind the wicket, would, they go, oh, the guy’s getting seventeen dollars a week. Because I knew men that worked in the bank, they got twelve dollars a week, that was their pay. So we were doing better in all the low pay in the mill than they were working in a bank. So those parents that wanted their children to end up in a bank, they could have done better to work in the mill, and that’s what we did. And I worked in the mills until 1941, when WWII started. I had worked all three different shifts at various times, quarter of seven, quarter of three, quarter of three, quarter of eleven, quarter eleven to quarter of seven, and my boss told me in the sheet factory I was going to go on nights again. This is in 1941. So I went home and was moaning about it in my home, and my brother said, why don’t you come down to South Portland, the shipyard is just starting, and he said, they hire everybody, and he told me where to go. So I probably, everybody in Lewiston and Auburn that could get a job went down to South Portland at that time, and it paid, we heard that there was a dollar an hour in the shipyard. Now, a dollar an hour was heaven on earth to us that had been making forty-three cents an hour. In my career in the Bleachery, the most I ever made for a forty-hour week, we had no overtime, the second shift, third shift, you made no more money than you did on the first. I got fifty cents a night because I had charge of my shift. Those I had charge of, there was three of us working. Now, I was not a second hand or anything, I merely could write notes to the boss or answer the telephone, and the men might ask me questions. I got twenty-two dollars and a half a week on that job. That was in the rayon department. And the men were getting twenty dollars a week, which was actually a raise from the seventeen dollars we had been getting. But a lot of the kids that I had gone to school with, working, over at Edward Little, we all got jobs in the Bleachery because there was some work there. And so as far as, I tell people this oftentimes, I didn’t notice the Depression. We always had an income, even if it was just mowing lawns or shoveling snow, or like I did, work, I worked in the Bleachery for seven or eight, nine years. And when I went down to the shipyard, the first place I went was in Portland, and I went to where they were hiring, and they were not hiring that day. So I don’t recall if I walked to South Portland, to the shipyard, or took a bus and went over there. And I was immediately hired over there by a man that lived in Auburn. And there was, all around me was all kinds of men from Lewiston and Auburn that I knew, and I went to work then. And I think that I earned immediately in the shipyard eighty four cents an hour. Now, again, eighty-four cents compared with forty three cents in the mill was manna from heaven. And, well, we felt so good. And we were buying war bonds during the war, too, we used to buy, I think the first one was like twelve dollars and a half, and they took increments out of your pay to buy the war bonds. And you saved them. I finally, I worked in the warehouse in the shipyard, and I can tell you how big South Portland shipyard was. We had six ways, where they launch ships, of from ways there, liberty ships. And they were built on a declivity so that when the ship was done, they knocked the chucks out from under it and the ship would slide right into the water, into Portland bay. Now, over in the east yard, other was called west yard, they had basins, and they built their ships in basins, which was like a big trough, and they could build a ship from the keel up in a trough, and then they flooded that when the ship was done, floated it out into the Portland Harbor again. But I worked in the west yard. And again, as I recall it, I worked in the receiving department. We 7 received the goods, where ours was was mostly valves and fittings that came to us for the ships. And we had to open all the packages, even if they were small parts, to see what was in there and record what we received, to see that whoever shipped us these things was not cutting us short. And finally I became a storekeeper, we started at eighty four cents I believe it was, and when I became a storekeeper, I was called a lost and damaged storekeeper, any material that was lost or damaged I had charge of, to get a replacement for it, and I got a dollar and twenty cents an hour. Now, when I got done working in the shipyard in 1945 when the war ended, people just gloated over the fact that we were getting as much as a dollar twenty cents an hour. Nobody that I knew locally got that kind of pay. I remember in the Bleachery, a foreman, if you got thirty or thirty five dollars a week, which was much better than the men were making, that was good pay. We heard a whisper that the superintendent that hired me got a hundred and twenty five dollars a week. A hundred and twenty five dollars was unheard of. We couldn’t believe it, and it was just scuttlebutt that we heard what he was getting. But I assume, and that was tremendous pay. He was a Bates College graduate and he was a chemist, and he got a pretty good job, and that was a good job and good pay at that time. That was from, during the Depression. And of course I left almost as soon as WWII started and went into the shipyard in South Portland. I finally got laid off as the war was drawing to a close, and it must have been 1944. So then I was looking for work. The reason I got laid off is I wouldn’t join the union. Now the CI-, this is awful, the CIO was trying to take over the union, and I remember they had little strikes in the shipyard and everything. But I wouldn’t join, I was in the AFL, American Federation of Labor. We were having trouble with the CIO. So anyway, I got laid off and I went down to the Chamber of Commerce in Auburn and told them I wanted a job, and he said, they’re hiring down Bath Iron Works. So I went down to Bath Iron Works with somebody else. Everybody drove a carload of people to, whether you went, which shipyard you went to. And we usually charged four dollars a week I think to somebody to ride, we had to work seven days a week incidently. We worked time and a half on Saturday, double time on Sunday, so whatever pay you got during the week, time and a half on Saturday, double time on Sunday. When I went to work down in Bath I had a, my wife’s uncle worked there and he was hauling a bunch of passengers down, so I went with him. I got a job right off down there, and I worked in the warehouse down there, but I worked in an office job there. It was a brick building, but you could have taken Bath Iron Works, area wise, pick it up, and set it into South Portland shipyard and lose it almost. And they had ways there the ships went down like the ways we had in the west yard in South Portland. And when they launched a ship, they knocked the chucks out from under it and the ship went out into the bay. But it seemed strange to sit in an office building in Bath, Maine and look out the window and see ocean-going vessels going up the Kennebec River. That’s why they launched these, they’re all, all the same kind of ships. And the quality of the ships made at Bath Iron Works was much better than the liberty ships. They were not as big, not as many tons or anything. But we handled a lot of valves and fittings, and everything was made of stainless steel, and better material. The captain had nice chairs, with lowers under them, and aluminum furniture. I remember during the period I was working at Bath Iron Works, they were getting rid of material that was left over from their contracts, and the war was drawing to a close. And I remember them shipping truckloads of copper tubing and pipe to Rhode Island. In other words, Rhode Island was still using this material, and we had no further use for it in Bath. They also said that there were no millionaires made during WWII. I could name you a company in Lewiston that must have made a million dollars in buying from the government and selling it back to the government when they could use it in another shipyard. That was just as normal, everyday thing that 8 happened. And so I say they’re Lewiston millionaires made, without a doubt. And we were not called millionaires, but we did a lot better than the G.I.s that were getting thirty dollars a month for their board and room. And when I worked in Bath, it seems though my top pay in Bath was ninety five cents an hour, which to me was quite a cut in pay from a dollar twenty. And I almost think that we didn’t have to work Sundays when I started working down at Bath, so we did get time and a half on Saturday. And we had part of our warehouse material in Bath in a shipyard that was left over from WWI, which was up further from Bath Iron Works. And some days we had to go up there and work because we had storage in this, it was a big wooden building, and that’s where we were collecting material to give to this person from Lewiston, Maine that was making money on buying goods from the government and selling it back to the government. But we would work up there sometimes, we had our own cars so we could drive up there, a couple miles out of the Bath Iron Works to an old wooden ship building. That was a survivor of WWI. I remember when the war ended, we heard about the atomic bomb, Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and it didn’t seem possible that one bomb being dropped could end the war. By them two bombings, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the war ended. We were given it seems a day or two off, and then the whole thing ended, that was when the war ended. And I lost my job at Bath Iron Works, so my career at Bath was probably a, maybe a year or less. My career at South Portland was more like four years. And as far as liking either one, I liked South Portland because I got better pay, and both shipyards I drove a car back and forth to work and carried passengers. You picked up passengers in Lewiston and Auburn and took them there, and brought them home at night. And then you had to pay to park your car down in Bath, or wherever you went. Somebody was making money on the parking lot."
"AL:","Did you ever go back to work in the mills later?"
"GW:","Never again. After I got done in the mill, I have had other jobs. End of Side A Side B"
"AL:","We are now on Side B with Gordon Windle. And you were saying?"
"GW:","If I should go back to the Lewiston Bleachery now, it’s privately owned, I know that I could go in the office or in the front door where we went to work, and walk through that plant and tell you where every place that I had ever worked. Everything was finishing cloth. The first area that I would take you to would have been the white finishing room, which was where the sheeting and the pillowcases were finished. There was many, that was where my grandfather worked, in the white finishing room. I have an idea that in his day with fifty-four hours, they probably never got as much as twenty dollars a week. And he always boarded in boarding houses or people that he knew lived in Lewiston. And my family bought a home in Auburn. But I remember, I could go through, when I worked in the rayon department we were below the level of the sidewalk even, we had to look up at the sidewalk, Lisbon Street. And I remember the superintendent, if he wanted to watch and see if we were working, he could come over after dark on our second and third shift and look down, see if we were working down there, or whatever we were doing. And that was, in the rayon department there was only ten or a dozen workers that comprised the whole of the rayon. And that finally ended, rayon didn’t take over the way silk might have, but it was good material, it was tough. And we had to make mixes in a steam tank. The wooden tanks were probably 9 made by Steven’s Tank and Tower Company in Auburn, and brought over there, and we could put live steam in the cold water and make it boil, and put mixes into the hot water that finished rayon material. And then we had to lift the rolls of the rayon onto the machine and run it through, we called it a Triume frame, and the Triume frame, the first thing we ran through was a dip that might have been something to make the cloth smoother or silkier, and then it ran into a frame with clips that made the cloth stretch to its proper width. And most everything was a yard wide, or thirty-nine inches. And you had to be careful, because this chain kept going. You could get caught in that chain. That was another thing people could get injured with. But we knew where the fingers were to make it open up if we were hung up in the machine. And it went down the other end, it was soaking wet, and went over a gas flame to start drying it, and then they went to a big steam drum on the other end that had a big heavy blanket, we called it, on that, and the material went between the hot drum and the blanket, and held it against the hot drum and dried the cloth. And then a man on the other end put it onto a wooden roll and started it at the end, and then ran each roll, one roll at a time, and he was a tender on the end, and were the tenders on the other end. And if anything went wrong and the material come out of the clips on the machine, we had to run and straighten it, or shut the machine off. (Unintelligible phrase) of fire, because there was flame out there, a gas flame. We never had fires there, but you could get burned, or steam, you could get hurt by steam. And here was a dye house right beside of us, they were sending material to us, that we finished. Some of the material that came to us wet, they put it into a, you might have called it a dryer, it spun around, like I don’t know how many revolutions a minute it would be, and it threw the water out, the excess water out. Then we got the semi dry rayon and put it onto the machine. Very heavy, to hoist that onto the machine, but we got used to it. One man on each end, you had kind of handholds. And we were three shifts there all the time. Quarter of seven, quarter of three, quarter of three, quarter eleven, quarter eleven, quarter of seven. And that job, I guess I put as many years in that one department as any other department that I worked in. I’m going to say maybe four years out of the six or eight years that I worked in the Bleachery."
"AL:","I’d really like to know if you can tell me about how many other family members you had that worked in the mills, and what their jobs were."
"GW:","The only one, the friend that told me where to go to get a job was just a friend of the family. He was working on a, oh boy, what did they call it? A machine that dried sheeting, as I recall it. And the sheeting came to them, sheets of course, I told you were, ninety inches were the narrowest one, and some were a hundred and eight inches, and they rolled onto a great big, and they probably weighed a thousand pounds when they got done. He was tending that machine, and that machine was doing the same thing as we were doing downstairs with rayon, drying the sheeting. And of course then pillowcases were only this wide, same thing. And when a machine, when a roll was made they took it off, it was heavy, and they put them on, they had trucks, we called them trucks, you could drop them onto a truck and push them out and start another roll. But the only relative of my family that worked in the mill, relative, was my grandfather. And I’m going to guess that he worked around 1900 to 1936. He died in 1936, and he was not working in the mill at that time. But I knew where he worked, and I knew the department he worked in, and that’s how I got my job, by telling the superintendent that he was my grandfather."
"AL:","Now, what did your parents do for work?"
"GW:","Shoe work. My parents, Auburn was called the shoe city, Lewiston was called the cotton mill, or 10 the mill city. And most everybody that lived in Auburn or part of Lewiston, worked in shoe factories. We called them shoe shops, we didn’t call them mills. They were not shoe mills. Shoe factories. And my father, in my lifetime, worked in a shoe factories, either Lewiston or Auburn, from the, my parents never had much of any education. Reason? They didn’t have much money, and nobody went to high school unless they were wealthy. And he and my mother went to, my father and my mother went to school til they were probably twelve years old. And at twelve years old they could go to work. No questions asked in shoe factories, see. And I remember my mother telling me that her great aunt brought my mother up, because my mother’s own mother died when my mother was eighteen months old. And her aunt that was bringing her up said, Pearl, my mother’s name was Pearl, if you quit school, I want you to get a job. So she went and got a job at T. A. Houston, which was a bakery in Auburn, crackers and so forth. And she did, and she, I’m just guessing again, fifty-four hours, probably four or five dollars a week. But my mother also could work in shoe factories, because you could trade from one to the other. There was plenty of shoe factories, probably ten or fifteen shoe factories in the two cities. The biggest one that was in, the two biggest was Alt Williamson in Auburn, London Suite, and Cushman & Hollis. My father worked for Cushman & Hollis, and he was the final inspector. I remember he used to take shoes off a rack and he’d look them over, see if there was any damage or any threads hanging, or any little things, he could take a little dye and fix a bad spot on a shoe. It was called final inspection. And I think that the most pay my father got as a final inspector for fifty-four hours, they never worked overtime, was thirty dollars a week. At that time, that was wonderful pay. And we never had to pay income tax, because if you didn’t earn fifteen hundred dollars a year, you didn’t have to pay income tax. So we didn’t start income tax til the war came along, and we earned more than fifteen hundred dollars. I can remember, my father used to walk to work. Now, we lived like a mile and a half, two miles on Summer Street, Auburn, from Court Street, Auburn where Cushman & Hollis was. And one day my father came home from work, and I went to meet him, and he was crying. So I said, what’s the matter? He said, I just had my pay cut from thirty to twenty four dollars a week. So that was actually toward the end of his working in shoe shops. My mother could go get a job, we were paying monthly amounts on our home, to pay for our home, or my folks were, she was called a skiver, which is skiving the edges of the leather where they stitched it for the shoes, and she was called a skiver, that was her job. So when my father and mother needed money to pay interest money, pay their taxes or whatever, my mother would run down to a shoe shop and get a job as a skiver. And she worked part time. So my mother, in my lifetime, more or the life of me as a kid, and us kids, she was home more than she was working in a shoe shop. But my father worked in a shoe shop until, I think the strikes and everything started around 1936, which was during Depression. And that’s when my father come home (unintelligible word) losing part of his pay. And he went to work for the city of Auburn. He was the janitor of Washburn School, which was my school, when I was out of there, and I think he got sixteen or seventeen dollars a week, janitor of the school. And of course he had to keep fires in the winter and all that, and walk around the yard and see the boys and girls were not raising Cain too much. But he did that for several years, as the janitor of a school in Auburn. And I was always proud that whatever job I had, I made more than my father did as the janitor in Washburn School, working for the city of Auburn. His wasn’t a nothing job, but it wasn’t a big job. And he had made more money working in the shoe shop than he did working for the city of Auburn as a janitor. I remember when my father worked in the shoe shop as a younger man, early, during his early married life he worked in an ice cream parlor out on corner of Sabattus and Main Street in Lewiston. It 11 was called Hollow’s Ice Cream, next to where the Shrine Hall is now was an ice cream parlor. And he got, he got three or four dollars a week to work there every night. And he went from the shoe shop to there, that added to his income, three or four dollars a week. That was the only other job that I remember my father had. But at that same time my mother could go to work in the shoe, there was plenty of work in the shops. Auburn always was noted for low price shoes. Their biggest orders came from Sears Roebuck and Charles Williams and places like that, when shoes were only a dollar and a half, two dollars a pair. And they made hundred of thousands of pairs of shoes per year. And when they came home at night, they smelled of the shoe shop, there was a smell to it. Not a bad smell. Leather, I guess, and dye. And so my father worked most of the life, his life and my life, in a shoe shop. When he first started, though, he worked in the office of a shoe building that was over on what was called Mill Street in Lewiston, that’s Mill Street that goes down to where the Libbey Mill was, shoe shop on the left. That’s the first job he had. He was working in the office. And he used to take money, I don’t know where the money came from, and put it in his hat. And they would tell him, don’t stop for anybody, take your hat and you and go to the bank with the money. And that was his first job. And he always carried a little note, years later, that they had written for him that said this was an honest boy, and give him a job. He kept that for the rest of his life. It’s probably somewhere now, I don’t know. I save everything. Then he went over to Auburn, and he worked of course during WWI. My father had three children, which prevented him being drafted. And he had had a broken leg, and they had to remove part of the bone in his leg and fill it with silver, so that kept him out of the draft, and he had three children. So my father was not drafted. And that’s when he must have moved to Auburn. I remember when the war ended, I remember the parade, I remember the big bonfire over in Peck’s, in front of Peck’s out in the square there, a bonfire because the war had ended. And we went over in a Dodge touring car that my aunt owned, and the top used to fold back, and us children went, setting up in the back of that, to Lisbon Street, corner of Lisbon and Main, and they had a bonfire going because the WWI ended, 1917 or ‘18, whichever. We had a cousin that was in WWI. He had been in the National Guard and he went and stayed, after the war he was a mailman, because American troops stayed in the defeated countries for a year, well, there’s American troops in Germany today from WWII, you know. Well they were there after WWI. And when he came home, I remember the day he come home, 1918 or ‘19, and he had what they called wrap around leggings. They was made of wool, and they wrapped them around their legs and they ended up by their knee. They didn’t have puttees or anything. And he gave us his wrap around leggings, and we cut them in two. They were long enough so they were long enough so I had a pair and my brother had a pair, and we wore them proudly to school, those leggings from WWI. He also gave me his mailbag, which was nice leather, that he had used. He became a mailman after the war, for the troops, and the war was over and then he came home. I remember when he came home, we greeted him, in Summer Street. He was my mother’s cousin. And he gave me a knife, a heavy knife with a spoon made right into the handle of the knife, and he also gave me a belt that he had taken off from a, probably a dead German soldier. A heavy leather belt with a heavy brass buckle. And on the buckle it said, Gott mit uns, which meant, God is with us, to the Germans. I still own that, I still own the mailbag. The puttees, the wrap arounds are gone, but that knife is somewhere in my, I save everything. Would you like to see a picture of my family that worked in the mills?"
"AL:","Sure. 12"
"GW:","Set right where you are."
"AL:","Okay."
"GW:","These are all brothers and sisters. My mother’s maiden name was Merrow, M-E-R-R-O-W, Merrow Road in Auburn is named after her family. This is the lady that brought my mother up after her mother died. This is the last person to work in the Bates Mill as a cleaning woman on weekends after they were through working, she went over and washed floors in the office. This is my grandfather, my mother’s father. These two men I never met, they both, this man went to Seattle, Washington, they all worked in the mills at one time or another. That was the last one to have regular employment in the mill, she worked there in 1927. And this lady also worked in the mill, she worked in the mill but she ran a boarding house on the corner of Pine I think and Canal Street, and she charged two dollars for women a week, two and a quarter for men. Now the reason (unintelligible phrase) was men ate more than the women, see. My mother used to tell me that. This man died in 1914, he went out to Seattle, Washington, but they all worked in the mills."
"AL:","This is all your mother’s family."
"GW:","My mother’s family, all named Merrow, they’re all brothers and sisters. There were two other girls, one got killed by a train down here near the old Edward Little, and the other one married and left the family as a younger lady. I knew, see this picture right up here, that farm has been in our family since 1804. That’s been in Massachusetts all, this is Massachusetts, you know, right here, and it was in Cumberland county, it was in Minot, it’s been in Auburn town, Auburn city, never moved. The land was bought by my great-great-grandfather for, one hundred acres, he paid three hundred dollars. The way I’ve heard it, there was a barn frame when he moved there. He had nothing but the horse that he had, and his watch. How he ever paid three hundred dollars. He was drowned in the Little Androscoggin River after having nine children. How would you like to have gone and tell his wife, we just fished your father, husband, out of the Little Androscoggin, he drowned. Running logs. I bet he was running logs to Littlefield’s Corner, which was called Nason’s Mills, with logs to make lumber to pay him for the house that he was, they built. So in other words, I knew, I gave this picture, or one like it, to the mill people, they have it. And I want it back, of course. But this one was just like my grandmother, and she left the farm, she owned the farm, she’s, and I inherited it from my mother, and I gave it to my son. And it’s my son, there’s four generations of Windles there. I’m the daddy, and this is my son, this is his son, and this is his grandson, there’s four generations of us Windles there. And I have three children, five grandchildren, and eight great grandchildren, and so I’m very proud and happy and, I’m so happy, that has been in our family since 1804, two hundred years. I save everything. This I think was taken about 18-, 1975 or ‘74, when the house was a hundred and seventy five years old. There’s me, and that was my mother, there’s my son and there’s my wife, and these are children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. And this is, see, I had a sign on the side of the farm telling about the date and everything, I was so proud. That’s a hundred and seventy five years of it."
"AL:","Wow, that’s neat. Now, is there anything else, because I know we’re getting close to ending, that you want to add about the mills and your experiences there? 13"
"GW:","The only thing I can say is, in my day, in working in the mill, especially the Bleachery, it was just like a family over there. Everybody knew everybody. I guess originally it might have started by English and Scotch people. Then it turned to Irishmen, and then it turned to French. When I got there, probably at least half were French, just like Lewiston and Auburn now. And the Bleachery Hill was called Corned Beef Hill. The reason it was called Corn Beefed Hill, because the Irishmen were called Beefeaters. They lived up there, because they could walk to work. Most everybody, there were twelve hundred I think working there when I got done in 1941, including all three shifts, and it was busy. We all, everybody knew everybody, and on your own shift of course you knew everybody, and sometimes they allowed us to go out and eat on Lisbon Street, and I told you about twenty five cent meal. Thirty-five cent meal was when they got high, that was high. And it was right up the street. I never liked to carry a lunch. Hated it. A brown bag lunch, or a tin pail, whatever, didn’t like it. But as far as, to me, a living, working conditions, to me, I liked the Bleachery all right. Part of the time I walked to work, from Auburn to the Bleachery, two miles, three miles. Then I remember I rode a motorcycle part of the time to work. Then I finally had a car, in 1936, my first car, and we could park it out front or on Lisbon Street. And when I told my boss in the sheet factory that I was going to quit and go down to the shipyard, he said, I don’t blame you. Because everybody was looking for, to better themselves. The hours, the pay, and the pay is what we were setting there working, and low prices, and we heard of a dollar an hour. Well, I didn’t start at a dollar an hour, but I ended up at more than a dollar. To me, that was fabulous, when I got a dollar and twenty cents an hour. Now I couldn’t get a kid to mow my lawn for a dollar twenty cents an hour. This is unbelievable. Because we were so proud of what we made. My take home pay, after everything was taken out, as I remember was eighty-one dollars and something. To a guy that had been bring home sixteen dollars and ninety cents, that was pretty good pay. And I was also buying war bonds. I always kept my wife at home, she didn’t work after we got married because we had children soon after, and I wanted her to bring up the children. And she was willing, of course, and so she didn’t work. I had to have enough jobs or whatever, I always had more than one job. When I worked in the mill I was still shoveling snow and mowing lawns in spare time, oh yes. I even delivered handbills for a store. Five hundred handbills, IGA handbills, for fifty cents. I still did that after I went to work in the mill. And I didn’t throw them in the sewer like some would. Every one went to a house, and you were not supposed to leave them in the mail slot, you had to put them through. You didn’t just put them on the porch. And I delivered them to all of Perryville, that’s where I had to deliver, for fifty cents. And I did that for several years after I went back, I went to work in the mill. And the snow shoveling, I had a paper route that I kept until I got out of high school, from 1927 to 1933 I had a paper route, Lewiston Journal, not Sun, and that was a night paper. And I had one of the two largest routes in Lewiston and Auburn, I had a hundred and five papers. I had Summer Street and Turner Street from Denison Street up, and I got seventy-five cents for delivering papers off my route, which was way up Summer and way up Turner Street. And if you made all your collections and everything, you got four dollars and seventy-five cents a week. Which was wonderful. I never had to ask my folks for any money. When I graduated from high school, I paid a dollar a week on my suit, a suit of clothing, twenty- four dollars. Two pairs of pants, a vest, a suit jacket, and an Edward Little jacket, all for twenty-four dollars. And it was Flander’s store. He understood this, each one of us went in and bought a suit, they 14 were called Oxford gray, and we graduated in those suits. And in that time, though, during that Depression, there were suits you could buy on Lisbon Street for twelve dollars and ninety-five cents I think. Stewart Clothing was one of them. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were two pairs of pants, jacket and everything. Everyone had a vest then. Imagine, twelve dollars and something. Or shoes, if you bought a pair of shoes that was five dollars, that was pretty expensive. If you bought a pair of shoes that was ten dollars, you had something super special. I remember we went, I went with my father once looking for second hand shoes, that’s how poor we were. We went into cobbler shops or second hand stores. We didn’t find any, so we finally went to a better shoe store, and I think he paid five dollars. I was so proud of those, because they were brand new. And I don’t know if wore them to bed, but I wore those shoes for a long while, because they were brand new. My father would always come home with something he had bought at a sale. And he’d come home, he’d say, these are horsehide, and they might have been made of horse hide, you know, different color and he bought them for two dollars and ninety five cents or something. Whenever there was a fire sale anywhere, we went to the fire sale, sheepskin coats, you could smell smoke on them, two dollars and ninety-five cents probably. One that don’t smell might have been ten dollars, see."
"AL:","And what was your father’s first name?"
"GW:","Harold, H-A-R-O-L-D, Guy, G-U-Y, Windle, W-I-N-D-L-E. And my mother’s name was Pearl May Merrow Windle. And my, that aunt that I showed you here, had a boyfriend named Gordon, his last name was Gordon, and she told my mother if she would name her boy Gordon, she would pay for the doctor, which is probably twenty five dollars in those days. So I’m named Gordon after her boyfriend, and I knew him, knew who he was. They never married. That was his name. Mark Gordon."
"AL:","Great, thank you very much."
"GW:","I love it."
