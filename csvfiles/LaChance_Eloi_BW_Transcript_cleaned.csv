"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) September 4, 2007 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Brick Makers Oral History Project. The date is September 4th, 2007. This is Andrea L'Hommedieu, and I am interviewing Eloi- Eloi LaChance: Eloi, yeah, they call me Eli."
"AL:","Eli?"
"EL:","But my real French name is Eloi."
"AL:","Eloi."
"EL:","Eloi."
"AL:","LaChance."
"EL:","Right."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"EL:","I was born in, in Quebec Province, a small, farming community in (name), in, in, in Quebec Province. I was born and raised there until I moved to Maine in, I was born in 1941, March of '41, and then I moved to Maine in May, May of '61 , 1961 , I was twenty years old."
"AL:","Now, what brought you to Maine?"
"EL:","It was mostly for work. I mean, back then, in our area, there was, it was a farm, farming community, and of course, we were a, we were big families in those years, they had big families, and we were. There were fourteen kids in the family, so we could not find work, every, any, any place that we could. So there was no, no place to go to earn a living really. It was small, small business here and there, but not enough to employ a lot of people. So back then, people were either moving to Quebec, Montreal, or bigger cities, and some were moving to the United States, and for some reason, I decided that's, that's what I'm going to do."
"AL:","Did any of your brothers or sisters come also? 1"
"EL:","Back then there were, well, I had one brother already here, my, it was, two years older than me. As a matter of fact, he's still here in, in Lewiston. He lives now in Minot, Maine, yeah. It took me a while to get my, my visa, and we needed a passport or visa to get through the border, and then of course, there was, they had somebody that had to provide us, they wanted to make sure that when we crossed the border that we had some work to do. So, back then, Bates Mill and Hill Mill were providing, I don't know, I forgot the name, what they called it, like a some type of work besides that, so when we crossed the border, we had some work, we could not be on welfare, or whatever. Yeah, so, so, I guess, and it was through Bates Mill, that I got my paperwork all in order to cross the border."
"AL:","So, that was the first place you worked when you arrived?"
"EL:","That was, basically, well, I, Bates Mill was not the first place though. Morin Brickyard was the first place that I worked with. Oh, even before that, because when I moved to Maine, it was in early May, and the brickyard was not working at that time. They started, it, it's, it, it was just as a season like, the brickyard. They didn't start early, I think, if I remember correctly, they, they started toward the end of May or early June to start to make the brick, because they were waiting for the hot season to start, in order to mix the mortar and the stuff there, the clay to make the brick. I mean they had to wait for the warmer weather. So, in the meantime, I stayed in Augusta for about, I think, about three weeks that I was in Augusta trying to, to earn a few bucks, because I didn't have much in my pockets. And in Augusta, I worked at a, Hill, what is it called, Hillcrest. It was a place where they, they killed chickens, how you call it, I'm not sure what you call that. They like, they had a place right here in Lewiston, they were doing that, a place where they'd prepare the barbeques and, and, and poultry. And I worked there for a couple of weeks, but, but I hated it, that was not my line of work, no."
"AL:","And so, then you came to (unintelligible word)?"
"EL:","Then when the brickyard was ready to, to hire, then I came, and that's where I decided to work, yeah, in the summertime."
"AL:","And what did you do there?"
"EL:","Oh, it was, it was all manual work, all hard work, really. I was not aware of how much hard work that would be. Basically, I mean, if you started, I didn't know the process of making bricks, I didn't know how it was done. But basically the reason is that they had to wait until the hot summer because they had to mix some clay, sand, and water really, that's the basic ingredients for, to make a brick. And you, it was like a big, big mixers, and they, they would have to, they had boys in the big pits, where the clay was all dumped in and the sand and the water, and then it became like a big heavy mud, that they will have to shovel into a mixer, and they were barefoot in there, they 2 were, I mean because, and like in, and wear a bathing suit like and nothing else, just, just that, and big shovel, and push that in the mixer. And then they had like a, to me, I thought it was very primitive to do it this way, but back then, that's how it was. And then they had like a mold, that was like, like a big, big board thing, was like probably three feet long by twelve foot wide with handles on each end, and you had to kind of pull a handle and it would press some dirt on that mold there, and then when they lift it up, it lifts, it lifts like a, it was all, how should I say that, it was all made up like a, it was like a steel frame on that board and they would push the clay into a mold like, and then when you slowly picked it up, it would leave like a shape of a brick in mud. It was really, really mud like, like kids would do with play dough, let's say. And then the clay had to be just the right mixture, not, not too thick, not too loose, because if it is too loose, it will kind of, the brick will not form itself like a square brick, it will kind of flatten out a little bit. So, you had to (unintelligible word) the right mixture to make a brick. And then, after that, they were just going to put that in a, on a big, big pallets, that more, I mean they will stack it, so, so they had a space between each of them, and then put it in a shed somewhere and let it dry, until it's really just a natural wind, the weather will dry it out. It's, and then after that, from then they will have to be brought in back and then there was like a big conveyor belt, I would pull those dried bricks, (unintelligible phrase) really, and then put them on that belt, so they will go into, they were calling that a kiln, I think, if I remember right, yes, and stack it up maybe, oh, maybe fifteen, twelve, fifteen, eighteen feet high, all, so, all stacked up, one, one way, one, the other way, they were, they were two by two, two bricks this way, two bricks this way, so there will always be a space between each of them."
"AL:","Right, some air, yeah."
"EL:","So, and for the, and then it was, it was burned, it was like a (unintelligible word). Once this was all done, we would put a, like a membrane all around that kiln, which was probably, like I said, eighteen feet high and across, it was probably twenty four to forty, twenty four to thirty feet across, and probably another twenty to twenty four feet long, so there was probably, there was thousands of bricks in there, all stacked up in there. And then we would put a membrane around it with mud again, it was just filled up and pushed some dirt and make it and seal it tight, all the way around, not the top, but all the way around. And at the top, we would just put some brick, but (unintelligible word) , but again to leave the, to leave the, the smoke and the heat come out on the top. So, everything was (unintelligible word), the heat will rise and cook those, those bricks, those pieces of mud, let's say, yeah."
"AL:","I've heard of people having to climb on it and wear wooden, wear wood on their feet. Did you ever observe that?"
"EL:","Well, that was after, not during the cooking process, let's say. Even though it may have happened, but I'd never seen that, I'd never seen. I know we had to go up, up, but that was not my job. To me, I did kind of all kinds of stuff, and when it was time 3 to burn, I did that as well. I was, I was trying to feed the fire with wood, slabs of wood there, and threw that in the fire underneath there to burn the brick. But, my, the guy in charge, I knew once in a while he was going up there to check how everything was going on, but I never, I've never seen him walk on it while I was burning. But once everything was cooked, and then we had to go and open up the top there, the brick that was laid on flat there to keep the heat underneath there, and then of course, you had to go and pick some up so the heat will, will come out faster once the brick were cooked."
"AL:","Now, were these water-struck bricks or the other kind? I know there was a kind of brick called water-struck, where like a wire went across the top."
"EL:","They were, no, they had like a, the mold that they had were, yeah, I think they had to scrape the top of it. I mean there was like a, there was probably a mold, and like I said, it was probably three feet, it was about this here, by twelve, (unintelligible phrase) it was like eight or twelve. And they had to, once they pulled out a handle to fill up, to fill the mold there, yeah, if I remember, they had to scrape the top of it, so they'd be all even, yeah, yeah."
"AL:","Do you remember any of the other people that you worked with, that any that stand out in your mind, characters or stories?"
"EL:","Oh, my goodness, there was a guy that I worked with (unintelligible word) . As a matter of fact, that guy that was in charge of the burning, I forgot his name though, but he, he was a, of course back then I was not speaking English. I was, I, I came from a French community, and I didn't know. That guy that was burning was, was English, was only speaking English, didn't know a word of French, so it was kind of a funny combination there. I was, he was trying, when he was telling me what to do, I mean it was more like -."
"AL:","Sign language?"
"EL:","Sign language, kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah, so, but I've forgot his name. As a matter of fact, once I bought my first car and I was traveling there by myself, I was picking him up in Auburn, and, and he was traveling with me, but I, up to the (unintelligible word), but I still don't remember his name. He was kind of a funny character, but a good guy, a good. But we talk much about, because we couldn't, we couldn't, we were not speaking the same language."
"AL:","I know it was very hard work. Was there -?"
"EL:","It was, it was very, yeah."
"AL:","Was it long days too? 4"
"EL:","Long days, yeah, if I remember, I think it was, it was ten days, we were working from sev-, seven to five, okay. It was a long day, because I mean it, it, by then it was just during the season, like I said, like probably end of May, early June until in November, until then, when it was too cold for the guys to be in the pit, to mix that mud there, then they had to stop. They had no, there was no, and the wintertime was, there was no, no brick laying, making back then. I don't know if they, I think they do now. Now it's probably year round because it's all inside work, it's all mechanized, it's all (unintelligible word). I've never went back to see how it is now. Is it still Morin Brickyard, is it still, are they still making brick there, or, I don't know."
"AL:","That's the one out on, past Washington Ave, right?"
"EL:","Right, in Danville, the one in Danville."
"AL:","Yes, yes, they are still making bricks. They do it all with oil now. It's all pretty automated."
"EL:","Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure it is."
"AL:","Yes, so it's very different."
"EL:","I think I'm going to, when I have a chance, I'm going to go back and look at it, and see how, how they do it now, after all those years."
"AL:","So, how many seasons did you work in the brickyard?"
"EL:","Well, I worked that first summer, when I moved in and then of course, at the end of the season, I had to find some other line of work, because I, there was no going back on unemployment. So, I, that, I went at Bates Mill, that's when I work and back then, they were hiring everybody, they always needed help there, I mean. I got work right away. And I spent a winter there, at Bates Mill, at Bates Mill, on second shift."
"AL:","And what did you do at the mill?"
"EL:","At the mill, I was working in the card room, yeah. And I did a little bit of, well, it was, the card room was, down, down in the basement, okay, it was opening the big bales of, of cotton, let's say, and feeding the machine to that, that, I mean that part there, I don't, I don't remember, I remember exactly what I was doing, what I did, but I don't, that whole process there, I can't, I can't really explain it, I can't really explain that, yeah, yeah. But going back to, for I did at the brick house, after that winter, then I, the following season, I worked there again all season at the brickyard, doing different, different basically the same type of work. But then, and the following fall , again, back to the mill, because we was part of the season. And when I did, then after that I, I stayed at the mill, because, and I was, I went back to the brickyard part, part time. I was 5 working at n-, second shift at Bates Mill, and then come home, sleep a little bit, go to the brickyard, and work almost, not a full shift, shift, but a good part of the day, come back and go back to work at three in the afternoon. Second shift was three to eleven, so I was juggling between the two, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"AL:","So, that was for two or three years?"
"EL:","That was for three years, yeah, yeah, yeah, for three years, and then, then when I, when I got married, then of course my, my wife, I married a French girl as well , yeah, so and when she moved here, we got married in '63, 1963, in July, and then we'd come up here. But I, me, I was always here, I was, I was living here, but I was traveling to Canada to see my girlfriend, every, every, almost every three, couple weeks, two or three weeks, I was going down there, yeah. Then the kind of brickyard work pretty much, back then, was pretty much part time, because I was trying to keep a steady job year round. And in the summertime, I would go back to the brickyard and do some part time work there."
"AL:","And so then, after those three years, were you full time at the mill, and you dropped the part time work?"
"EL:","Then, no, then after that, at the mill, were, after that I was starting to, to work in the shoe shop. Then I went to hand sewing at Belgrade Shoe Shop in Auburn."
"AL:","What was that like? It was very different."
"EL:","I can't, I can't, of course it was very different, that was all line work there, I mean we were, yes, (unintelligible phrase). I can remember I was, I had to go at school at night to learn how to do it first, because they wouldn't hire nobody who couldn't do it. Your hand sewing, I don't know if you heard of it. Well, you must have heard of that, I don't know if you've seen it done, or-."
"AL:","I haven't seen it done."
"EL:","No? No, it's all, it was all ladies' shoes that they were doing at that, that shop in Belgrade."
"AL:","And how long did you do that for?"
"EL:","Hand sewing, I probably did that for about three or four years, but it was, it was not, back then it was not steady. I would work, and then they'd have a lay off, and I, of course, being one of the latest in the shop there, I was the first one to go, so I was kind of missing work once in a while. So, that's when I decided, well, I've got to look for something else here, so we went to construction, and then from there went to construction work, drywall work. 6"
"AL:","So, is that what you did for most of your career?"
"EL:","And then, yeah, that's then the drywall, construction that was then that was pretty much the trade that I stayed in until I retired really, yeah."
"AL:","As a hand sewer, did you get an hourly wage, or was it piecework?"
"EL:","It was all piecework, it was how much, I mean we had, we were paid so much a pair, depending and was not always the same, depending how much it was to do on each shoe, but that's, that's how we were paid, I mean. And if they come up with a new model, they will test some people to see how long, to decide how much they should pay for that, for that type of work there. They would, they would give some, give a new model to, they had somebody doing that, and they were timing them to see how long it will take to do, let's say, six pairs of shoes, and then they would determine how much they would pay according to how long it will take to do it, and so that's why we were, each model, each different type of model was, was a different price that we were paid, depending on how long it will take to do it, yeah, yeah."
"AL:","And I heard that it was, if, if you could go pretty fast, it was really good money."
"EL:","It was, yeah, people, yeah people were doing, some people were doing good, good money. Me, I don't know, I've never been very fast, very quick, I mean I was kind of meticulous in doing it. Yeah, so, I mean of course, it was a living, it was a good way of making a living, but nothing to get rich on. It was, I mean you were making a living, yeah, making it go by."
"AL:","Now, is there anything that, that I haven't asked you about your times as a brick maker or in the mill or as a shoe worker, that you think is important to add?"
"EL:","Well, the thing is, I think what we did not talk about is how much, how much, the value of money, or how much we were getting paid by the hour. I don't know, I don't think I mentioned that, but with the brick, the brick making, I think I was paid like a dollar fifteen an hour. That, that was all hourly work over there."
"AL:","So, you were paid by the hour?"
"EL:","At the brickyard, we were paid by the hour."
"AL:","Was that a decent wage, a dollar fifteen, or?"
"EL:","Well, I guess that was kind of the wage everybody eamed back then at that time for doing manual work. Of course it was a lot better than when I was in Canada, doing thirty five cents an hour, if you look at this way. 7"
"AL:","So, when you moved to this area, there was still a lot of people though, that spoke only French?"
"EL:","Oh yeah."
"AL:","So, you w-, didn't, you didn't feel alone, or I mean isolated?"
"EL:","Well, I kind of felt, I didn't know a lot of people because, of course my brother was here, but besides that, I didn't have many friends or anybody. It's true though, any place that you could, that you would go in the stores or, you couldn't, you could always do your business in French, no matter. And if you go someplace and if there's nobody speaking French there, they will ask somebody around, anybody here speak French, and there was always someone that could. It's, it's, it was like, I don't know, the French language was, a lot of speaking, speaking, spoken a lot back then around here."
"AL:","And did your children learn French growing up?"
"EL:","Oh yeah. As a matter of fact, one of my, my first child, my daughter, when she started to, going to Holy Cross School, she would speak only French. She was not speaking English at all, so they had to teach, to teach her. And I'm, I'm sure it probably was hard for her to start with a bunch of kids that didn't, was only speaking English, and she was French, speaking French, so. Of course at that age, the kids, they learn quick, I mean they, they adapt, they learn quick."
"AL:","Did you have a chance over the years to go back to Canada and visit?"
"EL:","Oh, we go all the time. I just came back last night. We still go. As a matter of fact, I have a camp across the border, not too far from Lac Megantic. It's a summer residence that I go to, and we go every chance we have, if we have a chance to go, we go."
"AL:","Well, that's great. Thank you so much for your time."
"EL:","You're welcome."
