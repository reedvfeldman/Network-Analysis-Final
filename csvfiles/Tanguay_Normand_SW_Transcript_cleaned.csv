"AL:","And how do you spell the middle name?"
"NT:","C-Y-R-1-L-L-E."
"AL:","And where were you born?"
"NT:","Lewiston."
"AL:","In Lewiston. And your date of birth?"
"NT:","April 20, 1937."
"AL:","And did you grow up in the Lewiston area?"
"NT:","Yeah, belonged to Saint Peter's parish for twenty-six years. I was at Saint Peter's parish, and went to Saint Peter's school and Saint John's for two years, but then I had to go to work to help with the family things."
"AL:","And tell me about your family, your parents, were they from Lewiston, or did they come from somewhere else?"
"NT:","From Canada. They were not naturalized, they were Canadian citizens, but they stayed here all the time because there was work here."
"AL:","They came because of the work?"
"NT:","There was no work up there, so."
"AL:","And what did they do for work?"
"NT:","My father was a stone mason, lumberjack at first, then he turned into a stone mason , and then my mother worked at the mill for a while, but not too long because there were nine kids in the house, nine children, so she was not working. She had enough work at home."
"AL:","Yeah."
"NT:","The cooking and the wash and stuff."
"AL:","And within the nine children , where were you? Were you in the older-?"
"NT:","Seventh ."
"AL:","The seventh , okay. So you were on the younger end?"
"NT:","Others, yeah, were third youngest. We had four brothers. They're all gone now, three brothers of mine, but four boys including myself. The boys are all gone, and I have one sister gone, that's five sisters. Now I got four sisters. We're five left in the family out of nine, so."
"AL:","Yeah."
"NT:","It goes by fast."
"AL:","Yeah ."
"NT:","Yeah, as you get older you realize everything goes by fast."
"AL:","So you went to work at what age?"
"NT:","Sixteen, like everybody else in those days. Sixteen I went to work. I was working at the, I can 't remember the name, Bel Moe on Oxford Street there. And at the same time I was tacking innersoles and stuff. But I was learning to sew at night with my brother-in-law so when I got good enough I applied for a job in Bon-Ann, hand sewing, and they don't want to put me on hand sewing because I wasn 't a veteran. They liked to put veterans because they were getting paid from the federal government."
"AL:","Right."
"NT:","That, the iron workers are veterans, you know what I mean. But I finally get a job hand sewing over there. And I stayed there for six years but the last year was (unintelligible) because I used to do both jobs, hand sewing and hand sew tacking in the same time when they needed me, when they guy was out or somebody got hurt, I took their job. I was doing all the jobs, that's why he made me foreman . But then he wanted me to fire somebody and I said no. The next day I went to sign up for the Air Force (unintelligible) and he was mad but-"
"AL:","So you-"
"NT:","That was easy (unintelligible)-"
"AL:","Yeah, oh (unintelligible)."
"NT:","Yeah."
"AL:","Yeah. So you went in the Air Force?"
"NT:","Yeah , for four years, yeah. I was three years at Loring and one year at (name), North Africa. I worked in the kitchen in the food service over there, so I was in charge of the officers mess hall up at Loring. When I went to Africa they had all the civilians doing the work, except supervisors, so that's all I did, supervise."
"AL:","What was your experience like in Africa? That was very different than Lewiston , Maine."
"NT:","I was in Loring I'm sweating in thirty degrees below zero up there, and when I went to Africa it was 130 degrees Fahrenheit. It was hot like a son of a gun. You could break an egg on the tar and it would cook right there."
"AL:","Wow."
"NT:","Oh yeah, big difference. When they sent me to Loring they said , we're sending you there because you're used to the cold weather. It didn't last long . I didn't have no choice then."
"AL:","And so four years in the service, and then you came back to Lewiston?"
"NT:","Yeah , but I was married . I got married up at Limestone, up at Limestone, yeah."
"AL:","Did you meet your wife up there?"
"NT:","Yeah. At the base, she was going to high school. She was graduating that year. She was (unintelligible) me there and then we got married up there the year after. My older son was born up there."
"AL:","And so then you came back to Lewiston, and do you remember which shoe shop you went to next?"
"NT:","I had to go to Bel Moe, because when you go in the service they have to give you your job back."
"AL:","Oh ."
"NT:","And I want to get- because there wasn 't much work in town here. No hand sewing and stuff. But they have to give me my job, so I went on hand sewing here for three weeks I think. When I left I was a foreman . I could have taken the job as foreman when I came back but the supervisor, he was all nervous, he was an older guy. Don't worry about it I said , I'm not going to take your job, I don't want it. I just want to get my speed on hand sewing again . I got my speed on hand sewing and I got my brother, he want to learn so we went to Eastland in Freeport. I made a deal with the supervisor there and we worked there for two years, Eastland Shoe. And after that I moved. I kept moving. After that I went to - the one you said a while ago."
"AL:","Billings?"
"NT:","Billings, I should of went to Billings after that. I was there for four years at Billings. Then they weren't paying enough so I went to Sebago Moe in Freeport. In Westbrook, not Freeport. And then they kept saying they were going to give us a raise and give us, and they didn't so I left over there and I came to there -what's that little shop they opened up there? Not Outland- Timberland."
"AL:","Oh, yes."
"NT:","I stayed there for two years, and then they were planning a layoff so I went to look at L.L. Bean for a job. I never worked over there. I liked it when I got in there."
"AL:","So how long were you at L.L. Bean?"
"NT:","Hand sewing fifteen years and ten years at packing. That's twenty-five years in all."
"AL:","Can you talk about hand sewing and sort of describe it?"
"NT:","It's all in your hands."
"AL:","But how - I guess the question is, like what are the important things to know when you 're hand sewing? And are there techniques? Is it about efficiency? Because it's piece work, right?"
"NT:","You got to be doing it to really- it's hard to talk about because you got to be- all the leathers are all different, you know, soft leather, you can't overstretch it and you got to soak the hell out it so you can get it to stretch. And you have to watch your shoulders and elbows because you get tendinitis, bursitis and all that stuff in there. I was lucky, I was sewing over forty years and I didn't have hardly any arm problem except at L.L. Bean, the last year I was hand sewing. That's why I was glad to get off when they offered the early retirement there. I took that, right, all because I had stretched a leather and it slipped and it pulled my shoulder out like, I had problems with that. But it was a long, long job, but at least hand sewing, there was always work. It's about the only job I know that I could always go to, one place to the other. If you want to travel you could, you know, make more money. If you worked in town they paid less, and the leather is usually better than the other shops."
"AL:","So the quality of the leather is different -"
"NT:","Oh yeah."
"AL:","Yeah ."
"NT:","That's what it is, because a lot of times you try to stretch the leather and it breaks, and it's a waste of time, because every minute counts when you 're on piece work. If you break three or four shoes, you got to start over with another pair, and then they are going to bring you the other lace and the uppers and you got to start all the lacing that was up again. It's a waste of time if you 're not carefu l, and if the leather is too cheap. There was some cheap leather. So much of it was mostly plastic, made plastic. I did a little bit of the pre-punch stuff for Belgrade Shoe. I stayed there two days. He was mad when I said I'm leaving . A whole bunch of cripples left on the side. Oh , don't worry about those, he says, you done your best, that's all you need . I'm trying to think of the supervisor's name. Lester Frank, yeah . He was a good guy. Don't worry about it, he says. Oh yeah ."
"AL:","What was lzzy Viner like to work for?"
"NT:","I hate to say it, but I think he's gone anyway right? He was all right if you did what you were supposed to do. But if you made one mistake or you took too much time off, he was on your back all the time."
"AL:","Yeah."
"NT:","Oh yeah. But I didn't have no problem with him because I work, I was a worker. I learned all the jobs and, you know, every time I, every time he gave me another job I went in the office and asked for a raise . Then he wasn 't too happy. But the last time I asked for a raise he made me supervisor. He gave me a supervisory job so I would get paid more money, but it wasn't piece work and I'm not really used to that. And I'm not one to fire people, especially older people that slow down a little bit, you know. They wanted me to fire this (unintelligible). Not for me, I said. The next day I came in , I said, I joined the Air Force. He said , why did you do that, he says, I'm on the drafting committee. The drafting committee in Lewiston? He says, I could have got you out of the draft. I was single then and I didn't have no reasons to stay back. I wanted to get out of town for a change. But it was an experience, the Air Force, and it wasn 't like hand sewing. I had never cooked before, only in the Air Force, and I took all the tests and I was the top one in the tests so they made me a supervisor right off. I didn't even know how to cook. You know, I had to read the books and I was teaching all the other guys how to cook, new guys that came in, and I had sergeants working for me. I was just (unintelligible) first and then I had sergeants working for me. I wasn't supposed to be in the food service, I was supposed to be in the photography, in the airplanes, and they turned it over to the pilots and the pilots took their own pictures. All they had to do was push a button. There was no other guys taking care of the photos, so they gave me a transfer to the air police or food service, and I asked the sergeants, the older guys there, they said , take food service, take food service, he says. You get all you want, he says. Everybody is after you for favors , he says. Nobody gives you hell. So I took food service. It wasn 't bad . Well, it wasn't bad because I was supervisor. I didn't do KP and stuff like that. The other guys did all that."
"AL:","Right. And did you learn to cook from it?"
"NT:","Oh yeah . I remember what my mother used to make and that's how I used to cook. You know, they never had the spaghetti with meat sauce up at Limestone until I got there. They were making meatballs, and I hate stupid meatballs, I hate to make them . I started that and then that's all they wanted. They didn't want meatballs anymore. They wanted spaghetti with meat sauce. It's a big difference from hand sewing at the shoe shop, you know?"
"AL:","Oh yeah."
"NT:","It was only four years, but forty years in hand sewing."
"AL:","Are there other hand sewers that you can remember and talk about? I know some are gone. Maybe some of the older people that we can 't interview? It would be nice to hear about them , if you remember."
"NT:","(Unintelligible) Bert and Marcel and Betty Ann, we used to call him Betty Ann. He wasn 't a great big man but he had a stomach sticking out of him. They're all gone now. They're all big guys. They died in their fifties I think. Big man, strong."
"AL:","And they were all hand sewers?"
"NT:","Oh yeah. There were three brothers and there was one son . Bert had one son that was a hand sewer too. He's gone to Florida now, he's retired . Unbelievable."
"AL:","Yeah."
"NT:","There's quite a bit of them . A lot of them that I worked with at Bel Moe. Anybody mention Bel Moe before me?"
"AL:","I think so, yes."
"NT:","Because (name) was there, you know. Did you interview (name)?"
"AL:","I haven't yet but he's on my -"
"NT:","Larry (name)."
"AL:","Larry I interviewed ."
"NT:","Yeah , they're brothers, yeah. I taught Larry how to hand sew tack at the Bel Moe. His brother showed me how to do it when I went in, then he went on hand sewing, then Larry came in, I showed him how."
"AL:","So you learned from each other?"
"NT:","Oh yeah, yeah . They have no other instructors there. The guys that were there doing the job, that's all you learned. That's the best way to learn anyway, because they know what the problems are, you know, before you get to them ."
"AL:","Yeah. Did the techniques for hand sewing change at all over the years, or is it pretty much the same?"
"NT:","Pretty much the same. There's only one way you can do it, the right way. You know what I mean. Otherwise you'll break the shoe, you 'll hurt yourself."
"AL:","Yeah. Were there any tools or technology that were new that changed the way you did it?"
"NT:","They had the flat pliers and the pulling pliers."
"AL:","And did you use an (unintelligible)?"
"NT:","Yeah. The (unintelligible) have always been the same. They're never strong enough, they don't last. They don't stay sharp long enough. I don't have an (unintelligible) in there do I?"
"AL:","I think so."
"NT:","Right there."
"AL:","Right there in your hand. We're looking at a picture from an L.L. Bean catalog right?"
"NT:","Yeah ."
"AL:","Yeah ."
"NT:","The writing is missing on the end there but -"
"AL:","Yeah."
"NT:","My grandson printed it for me and he didn't put it in there right. I could get another picture if you really want one. I can get my daughter to make one. I think she's got the catalog."
"AL:","That's really nice."
"NT:","She went to work there for Christmas, for gift boxing and gift wrapping and the ladies over there, the old ladies, some were there when I worked there. They ask her and she says, well I got the catalog, I'll bring it to you. Because they didn't know me, you know, by name, as busy as you are when you work there only for Christmas. There's intelligent people that go through there every year and she didn't know if they had them so she brought the catalog and , oh yeah , I know him. Then they remembered ."
"AL:","Well, that's neat. Is there anything that I haven't asked you about your time in the shoe shops that sticks out in your mind that would be important to talk about in terms of the history of the shoe shops? Did some of them close on you over the years?"
"NT:","Weill left before they closed. When I heard the word , I always left. I've been to nineteen shoe shops in all I think. I only recalled a few here because the others, I can't remember their names and I didn't work there that long. So, but Sebago Moe, I stayed eleven years down there so I remember that one. And L.L. Bean and Bel Moe, six years. Four years at Billings Shoe, and Eastland two years. But (unintelligible) nights, and another couple of places at night. One we used to go get work but I can't remember where it was. I use to do, I tried to do three cases in a day and one case at night at home."
"AL:","Oh, you were allowed -"
"NT:","At night, at home."
"AL:","You were allowed to do it at -"
"NT:","At night, and that's from the same factory . Yes, from the other factory where two or three guys used to get the work from Portland even, Songo Shoe, and bring me two cases and the next day he'd pick them up, they were are all sewn , take them down there and bring back three more cases, and the other guy would do the same thing when his time came. So it wasn 't bad that way. It's a tough job. It's a fun job for me because I liked it."
"AL:","Right."
"NT:","I had seven kids. I didn't have no choice. I had to work."
"AL:","Oh, you had seven of your own?"
"NT:","Yeah . Oh yeah. That's why I couldn't do any other job besides that one. I tried , I went to , I took computer classes, I was ready for the job in Portland , they wanted me to go down there for work, I changed my mind . I was too old by then. It was all young kids over there, from college. By that time they all had computers in college. It was just too late for that. Even now computer jobs are changing, you know what I mean. They don't have cars no more."
"AL:","And so by the time your kids were grown , were the shoe shops really closed? Did any of them work in the shoe shop?"
"NT:","No. Well my youngest daughter Dina, she came to Sebago, at L.L.Bean with me. She worked there probably two weeks. She couldn't stand it. She was young, she was sixteen. I bet she would have been better staying there I think. She didn't have a lot of time after that unless, you quit one place it's not easy to get a job. I quit a lot of places, but I gave them notices. I go look for the job before I quit this one. I made sure I get one. You don't want to get fired with no job. She's the only one that work in shoe shops. My oldest son , he's an instructor at (name), the state of Maine. Dennis is a computer tech. He's an expert in computers. He installs computers for companies and stuff. He's in charge of computers in Maine Medical in Lewiston, Central Maine. He was in charge of the Portland but he quit there. His twin sister Denise, she 's in occupational therapy and has a degree and stuff. She opened up different places for therapy, head injuries and stuff. Now she's in Florida . Her husband is a chemical engineer. He works for the paper company, so."
"AL:","So they got all different -"
"NT:","Oh yeah."
"AL:","Roots?"
"NT:","Donna, the one I tell you is Donna. All these went to college, yeah . Four went to college out of seven. Donna is teaching part-time in Orland. She was a teacher in Sanford before, but she married this guy and got a better job offer in Orland so he went over there. They got two houses. In the summer time they live down by the ocean and in the winter time when the school starts he goes up there to teach school, and her kids go to school. She has four kids, so they go to school up there. The other three, they tried college and they didn't make it. They got out, they quit, they went to work. They work at the cashier, bank, and they work at grocery store, flower shops and now they're all in daycare. They all have their own daycare, three of them."
"AL:","Well, that's neat."
"NT:","Just like their mother. Their mother's only job she's ever done, daycare."
"AL:","Now is there anything else I haven't asked you that you think we should add?"
"NT:","About shoe shop?"
"AL:","Yeah."
"NT:","Know the reason why they took that picture of me?"
"AL:","Why?"
"NT:","Because I had a blue shirt. That's the only reason they did the interview with me and take the pictures. I took about a hundred pictures from all sides."
"AL:","Wow."
"NT:","There was four or five people around me with those big umbrellas that guide light and-"
"AL:","Right."
"NT:","Light checker and all this stuff, put it in my shirt and , because I had a blue shirt. Was there a hole in that one? I can 't remember. No, I don't see it anyway. Because most of them , I used to smoke the pipe and had a big pack of tobacco and it used to tear the pocket and there was always a hole up there in the corner, but that one didn't have one. I couldn 't remember if it had a hole. But I had pictures taken with a hole in my shirt, over the pocket like that."
"AL:","So they liked your blue shirt?"
"NT:","Oh yeah. It showed up good on the little thing he had there. But they take a different kind of Polaroid pictures of different people and then they give them back and they check them out. I was also interviewed by Geraldo Rivera."
"AL:","Really, Geraldo Rivera?"
"NT:","Yeah , at Billings, yeah. He was (unintelligible) the manufacturing in the United States. He say we will need probably two hours on that same bench . He asked me all kinds of questions and took pictures and stuff. And it was on the TV, when they showed it on TV they just did a passing shot of me, the camera , that's all there was of my (unintelligible) . And mostly them talking with the supervisors and staff about the working going down and all that. Yeah, Geraldo Rivera, mind you."
"AL:","Wow. He came all the way to Maine."
"NT:","Oh yeah. Surprising , yeah ."
"AL:","Well great. Thank you so much."
"NT:","You're welcome."
