Now (unintelligible phrase) I count, see my, my sister is a nun, by my father, so he counts her, but (unintelligible phrase), and he kept having kids and having kids, and he would count it up that way, seventh, I'm the seventh. And they said, I, I never, I always feel good, never sick, we, we were lucky. My father died of an accident."
"AL:","Did you grow up in Canada, or did he move you all here?"
"LB:","Well, in them days, you know, my father was, he was, he couldn't say no. Oh, Xavier, his name was Xavier. Xavier, I need to build a barn on the farm, you know, would you come and build it for me, because I have to put my hay in it, so it would be dry, you know. Okay, he told them. Well, when I cut my hay there, I'm going to pay you. He never got the money. Working like that, somebody, you know, they tried to get everything for nothing. He, he would have made good. Oh, I liked to build something for my chickens. Okay. You know, a little (unintelligible word), but you need the money. So when we left Canada, that winter, in the winter, in, in the summer, they used to go hay, up the (unintelligible word), they go like that in there. Now, they don't have to do that, they just buy the machine, and they work on their farms, they don't have to, but at that time, people who could afford it and they had kids. My mother's sisters, one had twenty six kids, and I'm not lying."
"AL:","That's incredible."
"LB:","The priest, everybody had to go to confession. They have to tell him, sometimes 3 they feel they didn't want no more, but well, we've gotten, we have to get kids. It's, it's terrible, what us, we had, we were twelve kids, and plus my father, plus his wife when she had the baby. The baby lived, she became a nun. And I count the other way, she had up on both sides, it was my father's kids, so."
"AL:","Now, how old were you when you came to the US?"
"LB:","Well, at the end there, everybody was waking up and moving to the United States, and we couldn't pass altogether. One started to go, we had relatives was moving in United States, so the first thing you know that guy's, oh, he's selling everything and he's going to the United States. My cousins moved before, they weren 't there then, (unintelligible word) the two oldest ones, they were good friends together, cousins, you know, so don't stay, after he went to war. I remember the first, the war we had. He had gone in the service, and he was not fit for, he was relative , relatively, he became a teacher, a school teacher, and so he had, he had to go to the war, then he was not strong enough, he couldn't fight, so he stayed there, he became, he was well educated, because his godfather sent him to college before, so. And he went into war, well, he was tall, and he was looking good, you know, and he was a teacher, so but he was not strong enough, and after the war, he come home with his, was my godfather, so his cousin over here, he was from Canada but he moved, (unintelligible phrase) moved to the United States, so he moved. He said , don't stay there, come over here, and you can have a good job, just because he went to college, and so he didn't do, after work, he had another work, because he went to war. He said, come to the United States and you're going (unintelligible word), you're going to find a job right away, so he wanted, he come to the United States, he went to Bates Mill."
"AL:","And this is your brother?"
"LB:","Umm-hmm."
"AL:","Yes."
"LB:","So he, he got the job because he talked very good French and he was big and (unintelligible word). He didn't work on the machines, but -."
"AL:","Was he a supervisor? Yes."
"LB:","Just because he could speak. He wasn't English, but he was a professional, he used to teach school, and they drafted him, and my god, some of them used to hide, they didn't want to go to the war, and they, they used to tell somebody, if you know anybody that they are, they used to go war, let us know, and for the money, they would tell on this, go over there and somebody used to have some place in the house and you could hide in there. And (unintelligible phrase), nobody knew about the wall, so that's they way we lived, then we-. 4"
"AL:","Then you all started to come over?"
"LB:","The cousins said, come to the United States and you're going to have a good job. All the oldest ones went one by one, and you put us in a convent for a year, four of them, and so we couldn't, I have two sisters that are nuns, so they said, at five years old, the nun, the superior, she used to, she said, this is wrong, you have too many kids, you have too many kids. You have a daughter that, a baby on my father's side see, and she's a nun, well, we have the right to (unintelligible word) three, we can keep one, one of the kids for free. So I was at the age to go to school, five, five years old, so (unintelligible word) , well, there's a sister, the sisters, they come from France and they speak the right language, they, they talk, you know, it's not like, all the people, some, it's just like somebody can speak English, but they have a hard time to, they don't talk like real people, Irish people. But the French, if you don't learn to pronounce a word, if we make a mistake, the nuns used to cut some little piece and they used to give us ten, ten little pieces, if you make a mistake, you, right away is, oh, you made a mistake, give me one of yours, and so we be careful. Me, I can talk regular French like that, but if I want, if I want to talk just like if I was high class, you know, I'd say, in French, they'd say like, (unintelligible phrase) aujourd'hui. And if you speak right, you'd say, like, what did you do today. What they'd say, qu'est-ce que tu as fait aujourd'hui, see? And me, I can, I can talk because I, like that, because in the convent we couldn't say, (unintelligible word) as fait aujourd'hui. Qu'est-ce que tu as fait aujourd'hui? So if I'm stuck with somebody that speaks good French, I don't get stuck. I learned that when I was just five years old, and it doesn't bother me even if it's a doctor, I can talk French, and it's all different because I used all the right words, pronounced good, so I've been lucky."
"AL:","Now, how old were you when you came to the United States?"
"LB:","Eleven years old ."
"AL:","And did you come with your dad and mom, at that point? Were you with them when you came to the US?"
"LB:","Oh yeah, well, see the oldest one, there was no work unless you're father's a carpenter and he, he builds you up, you know, to know how to build. You could find the work like that, as there was a store, you could, there were two big stores. I always, the oldest ones started to, let's go to the United States, let's go to the United States, then some would, you know. Are you familiar in the city over here? Well, you know, when you go down on Blake Street there, all them high buildings? That, the people from Canada, their father (unintelligible phrase) ."
"AL:","Okay, so we were talking about coming to the United States, and you started working in the shoe shop at age sixteen, is that right? And which shoe shop was it? 5"
"LB:","Cushman Hollis, that's where they make them, they try to find how many people lived, worked in Cushman. That was just me."
"AL:","Just you?"
"LB:","Yeah, yeah, and the boy that called me, his mother was one of my best friends , and she had worked there too, but she's, she's dead. So he come and he explained that, and I said , oh, your mother used to work with me, she started when she was sixteen years old and her sister was eighteen, and we'd been friends all that time. So she stayed a year and a half, which (unintelligible word) , so his mother, his mother is dead. So he said, we tried to find out those who worked at Cushman Hollis. He said , it's not. I said, you won't find too many, they're all dead."
"AL:","How long did that, what, when did that one close? A long time ago?"
"LB:","A long time ago, oh, yeah, about fifty years ago. When Cushman closed , I went on Park Street, and there was plenty of shoe shops over here. There's no more."
"AL:","Was it Weymouth that you went to?"
"LB:","Weymouth on Park Street. They make all (unintelligible word). So when they, that placed closed, I moved to Auburn, Lown Shoe. After I finished at Lawn Shoe-."
"AL:","How do you spell that?"

Oh, say, yeah. Well, my wife going to have a baby, what don't you come and work over here. They were lawyers, you know. So my brother was happy to have somebody there with him, so he called , write to my mother, maybe Blanche would be good for her, she can learn how to speak English, and he said, take care of babies. We were all good to take care of babies, that's how we grew up, with always a little baby. So she went there. Oh my god, they said, well, you know, lawyers, all them people. I had a little Canadian to come in and do work, she worked for us, and she cleaned the house, and she's very 6 good. Do you have a, do you have another sister, she can change, you know.

"LB:","Well, (unintelligible phrase), well, I said to Blanche, the shoe shop's starting and there's plenty of work if you come down, you, you can come back at the shop. So over there, in them days, she had fifteen, she had fifteen dollars a week, keeping the baby. So she couldn't do better than that working at the shop, but they were on strike and Fred said, come and work with me in Bos-, it wasn't Bos-, yeah, Boston, yeah. (Name) my brother used to be in Boston, so he had my sister to go work for the lawyer, you know, and she'd take care of the baby and we, we were -."

"LB:","Oh no, she went there, then they decided to come back. I said, come back to Maine because the shoe shop is, the work starts, you know, so she come back. So after that, well, then I, I get married, we all get married, but I keep (unintelligible word). When I was younger, I was, oh, twelve years old, I used to, after that I could, I couldn't go to school after that."

"LB:","After the twelve, then I babysit, four dollars a week, keeping three kids, four kids. One became a priest. His mother lived, I never heard of his mother. I said, I never seen her anywhere, I said, she must be dead, I've never seen her, so. I found out last year, she was still living . She died a hundred years. She had been in a nursing home for ten years. I said, I'll be down there. She disappeared, I never see her, I thought she was dead, sometime this winter. I'll be down, and if I had known that, I would have gone and visited her and tell her all the tricks the kids were doing to me. One day, you know, her older son visit, they liked to get (unintelligible phrase). I was doing , I was fixing the supper, and she used to work daytime, and she'd come in for supper, and I 7 had told her, supper was ready. The two little boys, they wanted to play, so it was in the summer, so I go to the bathroom, and they climbed on the stove, a wood stove, what we never used that, we had the gas. I come out from the bathroom, I looked at them and they were standing there on the stove. I looked up and they tried, let's go down (unintelligible phrase). I looked at them and (unintelligible word) , not now, you've got to stay there, you better stay there, you look good there. Kidding, you know, but, well, not now, don't go down yet, stay on the, stay on the stove. And they know their mother was coming at anytime. Oh, Lydia, please, please, Lydia, let us go down. No, no, you stay there, you're looking good. Honest, we won't do it no more, Lydia. And they looked and they worried, and I went, you looked so good, I want your mother to see you, and, and so when I hear the door open downstairs, all right, I wait until the last minute, okay, you get down. But all that time, (unintelligible phrase) say, please, please, Lydia, we won't do it no more, yeah, let us get up. And I didn't tell her, I didn't tell their mother, but when I heard the door open downstairs, I know she was coming up. Well, okay, (unintelligible phrase) you didn't wait a second, oh man, the sound, they were pleading, please, Lydia. I wouldn't let their mother see that because I knew they wouldn't do it again. But one, one became a priest and the other, there were four kids that, that baby was six months old, and I worked four years there, four years, I didn't know what kids was, but I never had trouble, you know."
"AL:","Now, I want you to talk about your time in the shoe shops, and describe the different things you did and the people you met. Now, at first was Cushman, can you talk about your time there? How long were you there?"
"LB:","Oh, I started at sixteen and, I started at sixteen, it was a french foreman, a nice guy. So I was not big at sixteen. After sixteen, and I go right away, I go at Cushman, that was a nice shoe shop."
"AL:","What did you do there?"

So that surprised them, you know, they said, they'd never, after I worked there all the time, you know, until he closed the shoe shop, he went on strike, and we could go back and work, and, but it was in spring, it was slack and well, there's a. I took, I took the first job they give me, and the top of the shoes, the top of the shoes, let's say, something like that, they would start to stitch the ribbon. My job is called, French cord. The first time they gave me just the vamp, I used to have the front shoe, then those, there were two parts, where the vamp and the quarter, you called it the quarter, because it goes just there."

So, that lining, the same thing for the back, (unintelligible phrase) . So I said, gee, it's not hard to do, but it doesn't pay.

Somebody take the shoe, (unintelligible phrase) , there's the quarter, that's the vamp, and they take (unintelligible word) this and that, you see, it's two sides, all right. If they have, that goes like that, now, (unintelligible phrase) on this side, and everything would be okay, and the French cord , I said to Maurice, I said, I'd like to go on French cord, if you need somebody in, well, we have, we have to put the shoes ready for them to, to glue and we stitched that little ribbon."
"AL:","Oh, like around the top?"

"AL:","That's handy."
"LB:","It's very nice (unintelligible word)."
"AL:","You liked working at the shoe shops? What did you like about it? What was it that made it fun to work there?"
"LB:","Well, you get to know everybody, and we had a little vacation once in a while. See, that's called a vamp."
"AL:","Right, the top front part. 9"
"LB:","This part, see, that's the quarter, this piece. Well, what happened, the piece inside, that's the lining, they called that lining, see because it's so. When it comes to us, all the stitches, they call it (unintelligible word) , let's see, stitch . The one that, see, that stitching, all that is stitching."

"AL:","And about how long was that? I don't know what year they closed. You said about fifty years ago?"
"LB:","Oh yeah, yeah."
"AL:","So like in the '50s, probably?"
"LB:","Maybe."
"AL:","So you must have worked there at least twenty years? Does that sound right? 10"
"LB:","Let's see, I get married, yeah, well, I'm ninety eight years old , and I had worked at Cushman, then when they closed I moved on Park Street where they have the big apartment there, (unintelligible word) changed that, you know. They, there was a garage over there, so they bought the, that big building and they made a hundred apartments there on Park Street. Well, I was, when they closed Cushman, I went there, and they had made a shoe shop there so."
"AL:","Did you do the same sorts of things at that shoe shop?"
"LB:","(Unintelligible phrase), then-."
"AL:","Now, stitching, did you do stitching? What was your main job?"
"LB:","Main, folding French cord."
"AL:","Okay, so you did get that job eventually?"
"LB:","Oh yes, well, at first we, see, I was, I was putting in a lining, that machine there, you put the stuff in, in, in that machine, and I, I had just to press my foot, that thing come up and I, and I, (unintelligible word), then after that, I said, I asked the boss, I said, I'd like to go to French cord, I'd like to learn that. So after I told him that I wanted work on that machine, we had to snip the French cord, so I was watching every little place we had to cut that ribbon , so when they pass it in that other machine, it folds over that, so it make, it makes just a little thing like that, (unintelligible word) you turn, it just goes like that, just so long. So then when they closed the shop, I moved on Park Street to other shoe shop there. They take me right away. Then after that I had a baby, and I said, I worked ten years, then I had a baby, so I go back to work. I stay home ten years for my baby."
"AL:","Right, oh, so you were home for ten years and then you went back to work, yeah?"
"LB:","Yeah, so after that, well, the foreman, the boss, he had a son, and he make you work in another shoe shop, make foreman. Then the worked stopped. They sent all the work out of town or overseas. It costs cheaper. Where do you go? Yeah, well, another shop opened, I go to Lown Shoe."

"LB:","See, so everybody, everybody moved there, and meanwhile, I was doing the sample, we were just two girls. The other girl is dead, she'd been sick all this time. So I had to wait, I, I was the last one to go. So I went there. The boss, (unintelligible phrase), I stayed ten years at, at the house, and I wanted to go back to work. My husband, he worked nights. I'm going to look for a job. The kids go to school, there's nobody to take care of, I'd like to go back and go to work. So I went there, at Lawn Shoe, start to work. Well, where have you been? All the other girls from the other shop, they're over here. Well, I said, well, I had a young kid, and I said, now he's old enough, he's in school. I said, I'd like to work.

"AL:","I think she got it."
"LB:","It's for me, she's going to come and tell me."
"AL:","Yeah, so I'm almost done, but I wondered if you had any memories of the strike that happened when you were really young, in the 1920s, the late 1920s? I think you said there was a strike in like in 1928?"
"LB:","Yeah ."
"AL:","Oh, do you know what the strike was about?"
"LB:","Well, that's, well, people wanted more money, and after I go in the other shoe shop, I was doing the same job, then I come to be a steward, and I used to get paid for that, and the first thing I know, I was doing the triple and the sample so ."
