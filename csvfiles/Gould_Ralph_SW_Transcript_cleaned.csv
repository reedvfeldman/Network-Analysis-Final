"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) April 30, 2010 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Industry Oral History Project at Museum L-A. , the date is April 30th , 2010, this is Andrea L'Hommedieu, and this morning I'm interviewing Ralph Gould in Auburn, Maine. Ralph, could you just start by giving me your full name. Ralph Gould: Ralph A. Gould, Jr."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"RG:","I was born in Haverhill , Massachusetts in 1923, which obviously makes me fairly old , doesn't it."
"AL:","And did you grow up in Haverhill, or move to -?"
"RG:","No, not very long. My dad was born in Haverhill as well , and we can get into the beginning of the company which will explain why we left Haverhill, but I left Haverhill at the age of five. So I was pretty nearly a Mainiac, not quite but pretty early."
"AL:","And what were your parents' names?"
"RG:","My father was Ralph Gould, Sr. , my mother Thelma Swann Gould , or Thelma M. Gould, she didn't maintain her maiden name. She was from Athol, Mass. , and they were married and came to Norway, Maine basically on their honeymoon ."
"AL:","Was that their first time coming to Maine?"
"RG:","No, he traveled Maine, and we'll get into that as we move along."
"AL:","Okay, so you were in Haverhill til age five, and then where did you go?"
"RG:","Came to Auburn. And do you want me to begin at the beginnings of the business?"
"AL:","I think that makes sense. Your dad , what was his business?"
"RG:","Well , he was with a counter company in Dover, New Hampshire, called Spaulding Counter Company, and they had another division called Three Line Counter Company, and he was a salesman for that company, covering Maine and New Hampshire. And he came to Maine and discovered that there was a small company just started in Lewiston , amazingly in what I remember as the Morency Block in Lewiston which is now where the Chamber of Commerce is in Lewiston . Are you familiar with that building? On lower Lisbon Street, near the school down there? Well, that was an industrial building at that time. They oftentimes now refer to it as the Pontiac Garage, because later on it became Pontiac Center's location. But in 1928, my dad found out that this business was for sale because the gentleman who started it, by the name of Price, had tragically been in an automobile accident and was killed. And so this little embryo business that I think only employed sixteen people was on the market. He thought this was a wonderful opportunity to do something on his own, and he contacted, knew anyway, Henry Scammon, who was then the superintendent of the Three Line County Company in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and the two of them decided they should buy this little operation up here in Lewiston, Maine. But that was not so easily done, because Mr. Scammon had five children at that point and didn't really have the resources to purchase the company. But his father was a superior court justice in New Hampshire, and he decided he would provide the five thousand dollars necessary to buy Mr. Scammon's share of the business. And my dad was a singer, semi pro, and made money singing at weddings and funerals and in the church and this sort of stuff, and he had amassed sufficient funds to provide his five thousand. So putting them together, with the help of a bank in Lewiston, they bought the company, which was then called Twin City Counter Company, but when they bought it, it became Gould and Scammon."
"AL:","So tell me what a counter is."
"RG:","I'm glad you asked that, because we should have gotten perhaps into that in the beginning. A counter is the stiffening in the back part of the shoe that supports the heel, and it's located, it's a molded, it was at this time we're talking about, a molded product that was inserted between the outer material of the shoe and the lining of the shoe, cemented in there with either latex or paste, and then assembled onto a last, a shoe last, and then processed through the manufacturing procedures. Now originally, a counter- and that's an interesting name, because originally in England it was called a stiffener, and then in France it was called a contrafort, and then when we did our business in Canada we discovered they were calling it renfort. Now, contrafort means stiffener in French, and renfort means reinforcement in French. And I suspect what happened is, when the shoe industry came to America they anglicized contrafort into counter, and I presume, although I've never been told, that's the story. But that's my presumption of the development of the name, because the name doesn't reflect what's happening , does it. Well, where are now?"
"AL:","So your dad and Mr. Scammon bought the Twin City Counter, and now did they change the name immediately to reflect that-"
"RG:","Yes, when they established the corporation , it then became Gould and Scammon, Incorporated. And they continued in that- did I, I'm trying to think whether we said everything we need to say. No, we didn't say, before I get into that we should talk a little bit about how counters started. Because they weren 't in the form that we manufactured, originally they were leather, they were leather blanks that they cut out of a piece of sole leather, and they would thin around the edges of the thing , called skiving, they would take, with a knife the would thin the edges of the blank, then they would wet the leather blank and put it in the shoe and let it dry in the shape that they had developed over the crude last that they were then using. Well, that became incorporated into the molding process, they developed molding machines so that they could shape the leather into the form that matched the last that they were running to make the shoe over, and they proceeded to do that for a long, long time. Then they decided they could use fiberboard and save a lot of money, so they then went through the same process as they did with leather with fiberboard . And fiberboard was manufactured in lots of places, but we had a plant right here in Hacket's Mills, which is on the way to Mechanic Falls, and there was another plant down in Bar Mills, manufactured by a company called Roger's Fiber, and they were our main source for fiberboard . So anyway, we went from flat leather, to molded leather, to fiberboard , and then we even became more sophisticated later on with leather boards and plastic components within the material. So that's kind of the story on the material that was used. Now, I'm trying to catch up where we were, we were talking about-"
"AL:","So you're on outer Lisbon Street. / ...."
"RG:","Yeah, we were out on outer Lisbon Street from 1928 to 1933. And in 1933, that __, was the year of the New Auburn fire, which was a disastrous event that burned down loads and loads of properties in New Auburn. And where we were at the lower Lisbon Street, we could look right over at the New Auburn fire , and in '33 I was ten years old , and I remember my dad took me to the factory to look at the fire. It scared the daylights out of me to see that terrible, terrible conflag ration. Well, they were then in the process of moving to Auburn, and so they were afraid the fire was going to jump the river and hit lower Lisbon Street. So they had moved all the machinery, they loosened up all the machinery so if they had to they could move it out, but subsequent, several days subsequent to the fire , they did move to Court Street in Auburn in the basement of the Charles Cushman Shoe factory, 207 Court Street was the address. And we stayed there until we built our own building in 1964 out on Minot 6_enue, which is a long way into the story."
"AL:","So talk about the company and how it grew, and what your role was as you got older. ~"
":","Amazingly, the company was started in 1928, and you can 't think of a worst time start a company, one year before the market crash. Well the good news I guess was that both my dad and Mr. Scammon had all their resources sunk in the business, so they didn't lose any money in the market because they didn't have any invested in the market. It was a terrible time, but they just kept plugging along with the customers that they had and slowly grew. Of course then you had the New Deal in '32, and the NRA, which was Roosevelt's program, and then in 1937 they had a disastrous shoe strike in Auburn and Lewiston. The CIO wanted to organize the shoe workers here, and it was a terrible time. Eight factories closed up as a consequence of the strike, and all of the factories were hurt badly by the attempt to organize. The CIO was not successful, and that's a story within itself, but a local union took place- we were never unionized, our company- but it did raise Ned with sales of the company because all their customers were hurt by this devastating strike. Well, they recovered from that, and then along came WWII, and production of shoes was extremely limited , leather wasn 't available, everything went into the war effort, and much of the product that we were then making became military. So they struggled through that. In the meantime, I was getting educated and graduated from high school, I went to Hebron for a year, and then I went to University of Maine for a year and a half, and then I went into the service. My associate, who joined the company in 1947, Henry Scammon's son Oscar, was with the engineers in Europe, I was a aviation cadet and became a pilot with the 9th Air Force and did my thing, and came back to the university and finished up in 1948, and joined the company then, joined Oscar Scammon. And so there was Henry Scammon, Ralph Gould, Ralph Gould, Jr. , and Oscar Scammon running the company. Everything improved after the war. Business was, generally throughout the country, was good, everybody was recovering from a disastrous period . And so we did very, very well, and the company grew, we expanded during the pre-war years and the company was pretty much producing product for shoe factories in the New England states, which means Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. They did a little business in New York, in the New York area, but that's where most of it was. Well, we decided we'd better go elsewhere and do better, and so we opened up upstate New York, we did Pennsylvania, we employed a fellow by the name of AI Boucher to be representing us in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and I covered Maine and upstate New York, and then forayed into Canada, and we did some business up there. In fact, a substantial amount of business in the locations that I've cited. So my dad was not doing too well physically in the fifties , he had emphysema, which amazingly, well of course he smoked and that was one reason he had emphysema, and it of course didn't help his singing too much, but he became less and less able to carry on. And so in 1956, I became much more responsible for what he was doing, and he died in '58. But before he died, he and Henry Scammon decided that it was time to let Oscar Scammon and I have our leash, if you will , so we organized a new company, continuing to call it Gould and Scammon, and we bought out over time the old Gould and Scammon from my dad and Henry Scammon. Henry Scammon stayed on as a consultant, more than a consultant really, but Oscar and I owned the business then and all of the vagaries that go with that."
"AL:","Well, to me it's amazing that your father and Mr. Scammon built this business from 1928 and just continued on for years and years, and then you and Henry's son Oscar took it over and continued it. I mean it's a unique situation where two generations from two families can get along so well. How did you make it work all those years? RG : Well , I can answer that easily, I think. When the business started in '28, Henry Scammon was then very, very familiar with counter operations. He became Mr. Inside. My dad was Mr. Outside, because his expertise was in sales. And so the two of them allowed their area of expertise to rule decisions if there was ever a debate, and so they just never got into each other's hair, they got along just wonderfully well, amazingly well. Oscar Scammon was sort of like his dad, he was not comfortable in the area of sales and I was, so we sort of duplicated the original intent of our dads. Although I must say that I probably got more aggressive about things in general , I was the president by decision , he became the treasurer and I was the president, and so I tended to maybe muck in a little bit more. But we got along fine , he was very willing to let me have a say in a lot of areas that perhaps, well, we became more sophisticated and we needed to have a voice. We had a director, Lake Adam, the only outsider in the firm, and he ran an accounting firm so he helped us a great deal in the financial , or fiscal area of the business. We were blessed with some terrific employees, some that started in my dad's days in the thirties stayed right with us, and two of them were our foremen . And we just had wonderful, wonderful people working for us. When we were twenty-five years old, it was amazing how many of the people that were then employed by us had been with us for long, long periods of time. And contrary to the philosophy of a lot of companies, we encouraged relationships with our employees from the point of view of bringing in their cousins and their kids and their friends, and the only time it was bad is when somebody died , we had a lot of people that had to go the funeral. But we had wonderful interrelationships with our employees. Another thing that we did that is a real bragging point, in the very early fifties we established a profit sharing plan, and it was one of the early profit sharing plans in the ( state of Maine. In fact, when my dad died the distribution from the plan became a court evaluation to determine the tax factors in the distribution. And for many, many, many years we gave the maximum which was allowed to give to profit sharing, which was fifteen percent of your earnings, and we just felt great about things like that. And I think this is one reason why we had such loyalty amongst our people. The plan was not one that you could just carelessly decide you wanted in or out of, you really, we took the position that it was a retirement plan , and if you decided that you wanted it so bad that you were willing to give up your job, you could get it. But most people left it set. And as a matter of fact we had , when our two oldest employees from 1931 retired , it was the best thing that could happen to them because they had this lovely nest egg which added to their Social Security, made it possible for them to have a very comfortable retirement, so we felt great about that. Now, what else do you want to know?"
"AL:","In terms of numbers of employees, do you recall how that went up and down?"
"RG:","Yes, the biggest year of the company was in 1968, that was our highest sales level , and we had a hundred and forty employees. And when you figure that Twin City Counter started out with sixteen, that was a lot of gain."
"AL:","And you 're now over on Minot Avenue?"
"RG:","The company is still on Minot Avenue, but they're not doing much in the product that we created because the shoe industry has changed dramatically from those days. We were very concerned about diversification. You could tell in 1968 that the shoe industry was destined for decline, and it happened very gradually after that peak point. And so we knew that if we didn't get into some other things, it might be a little difficult for us. So starting in I guess probably the late fifties, we started looking for opportunities to diversify, and one of the things that we did, that was not too smart on our part, we bought a fledgling bottling company. Nehi beverages was not doing well, and so we said , well that's an interesting approach . So we bought it and tried to make a- fortunately, the company owned it and not us individually- and we had all of the lost leaders in the industry, we had Royal Crown and Diet Rite and Orange Crush and Hires Rootbeer, and Moxie, we had Moxie. And we felt, well, if we had enough brands, even though they weren't the leaders, we could all right. The amazing thing was that Royal Crown was on the edge of terrific success, because they had Diet Rite, which was the first diet beverage."
"AL:","Oh, before Tab?"
"RG:","Before all of those. And they were doing well, but it was made with cyclamates, and cyclamates was declared a no-no by the federal government and you couldn't use it anymore. Well of course what happened is, they found some other things that they could use, but they had the edge of the diet business, the federal government said, you can't do it, and then they came along about four years later and said, oh , we made a mistake, it's okay now. But Royal Crown lost the opportunity to be the leader, and we lost an opportunity too. Well, we struggled with that for four years , we added beer in the line, and we never made it, so we gave it up. But I should add at this point that we felt we needed some additional leadership in our company, and so I had a friend of mine that I went to high school with , a local boy, by the name Dana Bunker, and Dana was with United Shoe. (Taping paused)"
"AL:","And so you said Dana Bunker, he joined you in '59?"
"RG:","In '59, and he had an engineering background, and that seemed to be where we needed some strengths. And we knew that sooner or later molded counters , as they were being produced at that point, had to have some added sophistication , because the shoe industry was looking then at what they called back part molding. They wanted to be able to put a product in the back of shoes that could be formed in the shoe manufacturing process rather than preformed , as we were presently doing things. So we hired A. D. Little to give us an assist in the area of developing a thermoplastic product, and Dana became responsible for that segment of our business. We were not successful , regretfully. So we attacked some other areas, and one of them was the ill- fated bottling business which Dana ran too, he was the guy that we sent off on errands to try to do better. We also bought a heel business and ran that for a while then sold it, that was a good exercise in not making any money but learning another aspect of the business. And I'm jumping around a little bit, but in '69, I had mentioned earlier that we were doing business in Canada, and I can take a little credit I guess for this, our product was extremely well received in Canada, but our prices were higher, the American dollar was higher than the Canadian dollar. But despite that, the women's manufactu rers in Canada, in eastern Canada, mostly in Montreal a little and Quebec, some over in Ontario, really liked the quality of our product. So we were doing pretty well and hurting the local boys up there. We decided that maybe it was a good time to have an operation up there. So a fellow by the name of Fred Overlander, who was a friend of ours, ran a small counter operation and he decided it would be great to merge our talent with his, in his plant, with some of his equipment and some of ours, so we set up a company called GSM, Gould , Scammon, Millmont, Millmont being Freddie's company. And we just did wonderfully well up there. Boy, they were delighted , the Canadian manufacturers were delighted to have us, because it improved their product at the same time."
"AL:","And so that we you had a local, the supply was local, it wasn 't a lot of -"
"RG:","Yeah, yeah, plus you avoided the conflict between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar. So Dana, and Oscar sometimes, and I would be going back and forth to Canada quite frequently for over a two year period. Then one of the competitors in Canada , being more than painfully aware of our presence up there, offered to buy the business, and offered to give Fred a chance to be the sales manager of the company that would result from the purchase. It was too good to be passed up from Freddie's point of view, he had a building up there and machinery and so forth , so we sold. And we sold advantageously. So we had to accept a five-year agreement to not compete in Canada, so for five years we had to stay out. After the five years, we went back up to Canada and continued to do pretty well in Canada . But I'm getting well ahead of myself. But that was, there was an adage that you heard often, and it was, ""shoemaker, stick to your last,"" meaning stick to the things that you know how to do well. And so we were guided by that, we probably looked at at least a dozen opportunities, some within the shoe industry, some outside the shoe industry, that might represent opportunities to diversify. None of them really suited our talents or provided what we presumed to be a good opportunity. We did , however, decide to get into the box toe business, which was somewhat akin to counters, being the front end of the shoe and the back end of the shoe, both something that had to be inserted into the shoe. And so we bought a company called Ragano (sounds like) Box Toe in Haverhill and ran that for (taping paused)- I was speaking about Ragano Box Toe, and it was in 1976 that we bought this company in Haverhill, back in Haverhill, and ran it for a number of years, using box toe material produced by Foss Manufacturing. Ultimately, they wanted to vertically diversify and pressed us to sell Ragano to them, which we did , again profitably to ourselves. That was in '76."
"AL:","At that point in time, were you finding your numbers of suppliers shrinking, were you having to go further and further to get the same amount of business?"
"RG:","You don't mean suppliers, you mean customers."
"AL:","I mean customers, sorry."
"RG:","Yes, and I'm glad you introduced that subject. We had at that point Dick Varney as the full time salesman in Maine, we had Bill Mag, a full time salesman in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, we had a full time salesman in Pennsylvania who covered upstate New York, we had representatives in New York City and the environs of New York City, down into Baltimore, Maryland , we had representatives in every other shoe area in the United States and Canada, except St. Louis, no, sorry, we had someone in St. Louis, except California. Tried to do business in California but they didn't use counters sufficiently to make it worthwhile. I think in 1968 we were the largest manufacturer of shoe counters perhaps in the world, certainly in North America , so yeah, we grew, we grew a lot. And I think it's a credit to the darn good product that we produced. We had all of the big names except General and International , who were pretty much in St. Louis and that south central part of the country. We did something with them , but not much. We had acquired all of Enidicott Johnson's business, most of Melville's business, we did business with all of the, practically all of the big names, and so it was a pretty satisfying bit of business. And of course I used to have to travel all over North America to see the customers, I wanted to see everybody twice a year, so we had a very close relationship with them, not only making a good product but with close contacts between the factory and them . So that worked out well. My son came on board in 1977. We decided that we needed another executive in the company to handle the growth, and he had just graduated from the University of Maine and amazingly had decided to ride his bicycle with two of his classmates from the east coast to the west coast. He put his bicycles wheels in the water in Old Orchard Beach, and put his bicycle wheels in the water out in Seattle, or near Seattle, Washington , or Oregon, one of those places. And he stayed out there, because his lady friend, whom he married, Ann, was going to school out in Victoria, British Columbia. Well, when we decided we needed somebody, I contacted him and I said , here's a chance for you if you want to take it. He took it, came home, and went to work for us, in all aspect of the business. He understudied Oscar Scammon and understudied me, and was a terrific addition to the company."
"AL:","As he was growing up, as he was a kid growing up, did he sort of get immersed in the business then, or was it really after, when he was grown up that he -?"
"RG:","Yeah , the latter. Contrary to Oscar Scammon and I, when we were kids, we would go to the Y on Saturday and come back, and the plant ran Saturday mornings oftentimes, or at least the management was around, we'd go in and punch the time clock and pretend that we were workers. So Oscar and I were much closer to the company during our growing years than my son was. He was pretty much aware of it, but he didn't get wrapped up in it like that. But once he got involved , he was totally involved . Did a lot of work in Canada. Then when we sold the business in '83, which is, I'm advancing a little bit here, he became president of the successor company at the request of the people that bought it, and I became chairman, vice chairman as a matter of fact. And so they recognized his talent at that point, and he stayed on as president of the successor company for seven years before he went on to do other things."
"AL:","And what was the successor company?"
"RG:","Okay, you're ready to get into that. We received an inquiry, a blind inquiry in 1982 of somebody that wanted to buy us. And I wasn 't very much impressed. We felt that the company had its difficulties as the shoe industry was declining, but I wasn 't much impressed with somebody who didn't want to identify themselves as to who was interested. Well, they got back to us a little later on and it turned out to be a company called L. Farber in Worcester, Massachusetts. Now, L. Farber was a manufacturer of leather welting, and they were the premier manufacturer of leather welting, which impressed me, and they said they wanted to buy the premier company in counters. So, well, all of a sudden our ears perked up a little bit. Oscar Scammon I think was enthusiastic about it, because he did not have a son in the business and didn't plan to at that point. I was a little nervous about pulling the rug out from underneath David, my son, but we talked about it and he said , Dad, this is the best thing we could do. We can see the handwriting on the wall that things are going to get tougher, and this is a wonderful chance to become liquid. So having that knowledge, we agreed to sell. But I'm a little bit ahead of myself here."
"AL:","Okay, well go back to where we need to be."
"RG:","I'm trying to think where that is. I had mentioned earlier that we had investigated a lot of purchasing opportunities and declined most of them. We did buy Ragano Box Toe. We also bought three counter companies, one in Rochester, New York, one in, initially, the first one, was Rogers Fiber. Rogers Fiber was the supplier of our fiberboard . They also had a counter plant, and it seemed to them that they were a little bit in conflict of interest, manufacturing something that was in competition he sold board to, so they wanted to sell. Well, that was our first purchase of a counter plant, we bought Rogers in 1964. And I'm glad I mentioned 1964 because that was the year that we decided we had to get more space. If Rogers wanted to become part of our operation , we had to have space. And so we started looking around , we had about 25,000 sq. ft. in the basement of the Cushman Building, which had served us well. So we started looking around and we found out there was space, Bob Roy had some space over in the Continental Mill, and that looked pretty good to us, and it was a lease arrangement. So we said yeah , I guess maybe we ought to take that space, it was going to be adequate for our needs. So I went over to Woody Brackett, who was then city manager of Auburn , and I said Woody, I hate to tell you this, but we're going to have to leave Auburn , we're going over to Lewiston. He says, you wait just a minute, young fella , and he said , I think we can do something for you. Well, don't you know, in a matter of a few days he had lined up some land that the Auburn Business Development Corporation owned out on Minot Avenue, said he would help us to get started, and we ended up building a brand new building of 48,000 sq . ft. out on 1130 Minot Avenue, which was the best thing we could have done. So, that happened in '64, we moved , Herbie Callahan built the building for us on a handshake, and he built it so that the two weeks of the vacation period , in Fourth of July vacation period, we could prepare to move in, and we had that two-week window which wouldn't mess up our production. And we moved Rogers in , and we moved ourselves in, and we were operational I think one week after the vacation period. And it was wonderful. We put another addition on , another 10,000 ft. addition onto the building before we got through. We also bought Prosper Chavonelle (sounds like) , which is a counter company, and then in '82, New England Counter Company, which was our major competitor, located in the Lown Building here in Auburn , decided they wanted to sell. They had merged six or seven counter companies into their counter company, and we had merged three into ours, so we ultimately bought New England Counter Company which increased our productivity twenty-five percent, and we were the amalgamation of about nine different counter companies that had existed before all this took place. Which brings me to the point that, when we got going after the war, there were thirty counter companies in the United States that produced the same sort of product we did . And when we finally merged New England in, I think there were only five left. Everybody else had either sold or liquidated or whatever. So no sooner had we bought New England Counter than this event with L. Farber came along, so we looked all the more attractive of course to Farber. And so we ultimately sold to them in '83, and Oscar Scammon decided to retire , he didn't want to become involved in the new Gould & Scammon, but Dana and my son and I all joined up, and David, my son, became president, and Dana stayed on in his various roles, as did I. And I stayed with them until the end of 1990, Dana retired I think in 1987 to live in Florida, but he stayed close, and David stayed with the company until '91 , but at that point they were having difficulties because they had gotten too greedy and bought too many other companies and ultimately had to sell off. And so in 1991 Norman Ferrar of Canada Counter Company bought Gould & Scammon, owned by L. Farber, and changed the name to Enefco, which stood for Norman Ferrar, and it continues to operate out on Minot Avenue , although Norman sold it to another group later on. And they still produce some molded counters. Not many, military largely, some, a few women's old fashioned shoes, nun's shoes, so to speak, are still being made with molded counters, and so is Redwing , out in Wisconsin, still using molded counters from this company. That is probably a snapshot of everything, and I've left a ton of things out, but maybe that's close enough."
"AL:","Yes, that's an amazing story. Thank you."
"RG:","Yeah , it's a pleasure."
