"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) August20,2009 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Workers Oral History Project at the Museum L.A. The date is August 20, 2009, and this is the second interview we're doing with Jerome Feinstein, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. Last time we left off, we had made it through World War II, your experiences there. And we want to get to your time in Maine and how you got involved , in different ways, in the shoe industry. Can you set that context for us? Jerome Feinstein: Well, I can tell you this, let's start when I came back from the service. I came back and took over- and I'll cut through a lot of the red tape- I took over as manager of the Clark Shoe Company. They were making men's Goodyear welt shoes. I had complete authority in there, I even bossed the boss around, Mr. Koss. What I said went, because he himself depended on my decisions and everything that went along with it. Now, from that point on , and this is in the year 1946, when I took over his plant, I remained with him until the year 1961 . In the early part of '61, I myself went in the business on my own. He made men's Goodyear welts. I went in, I would not make the same type shoes that he would make, I went and did something that I never made in my life. I made men's handsewn shoes. So I opened up my own factory, and I figured I'll learn as I go along."
"AL:","And what was the name of that factory?"
"JF:","That was Billings Shoe Company. I had a salesman by the name, had a son who's name was William, Bill, and my son's name was Leonard, and as a result, we took parts of both names and named it Billing Company, at the time, because I didn't want to start anything, as far as Mr. Koss was concerned. I felt close to him, I felt obligated to him, and I certainly did not want to hurt him. When I went in the business, I went in and I still worked for him running his factory, and I would go over to my own factory, where I started it up, at night and I would work there till all hours of the morning. My time, it wasn 't easy for my wife, because I left her alone, and I told her, don't bother and don't feel sorry for me, because I'm young, thank God, and I said, I can do it, and I can take care of myself. Don't make any social arrangements for me either. Do what you want, and I'll go along with you, but don't feel sorry for me, because this is what I want, or I'll never be happy. This is what started then . I then went along with him for another six months, and enough was enough, and I finally said to him that, I think now I have to leave you. In my own plant, all my executives who I hired there and left there, that were running , were all instructed one thing, if anybody applies for a job in here who says they worked for Koss Shoe Company, take their name and telephone number and say, when there's an opening , we'll call you . You make sure you do not hire anybody that works, that uses the name Koss Shoe Company. I don't want him hurt at all. In other words, it's going to be your job. So we took off from there. I started on Washington Street, in a little small place which was originally Chippy Sabelman's (sounds like) wood heel factory, where he started. Now, I had to move, and Woody Brackett was the manager of the city of Auburn at the time, and I said, I got to find a place, I can't close down for time to move, I have to do it over the week's vacation over the fourth . This all has to be over the fourth so I lose no production. We'll be down for a week, and that's when I move. So he said to me, well, we'll find a building for you. I says, you better find it in a hurry. So, we looked. There was the building around the circle there, used to be a bakery, but he says, I have that for you Jerry, you come on in and I'll show it to you. I went in, I says, the bakery, I says, was sky high . You walk in and the ceilings were, if you put in floors in there, you could put in two floors. I says, just empty space. I says, and so what we're talking about was square footage would be on the floor, which meant nothing to me, because I wanted to expand as we went along. I says, so this building wasn't any good . I says, Woody, I appreciate what you're showing me. He says, why don't you hang on . I says, no. Meanwhile I bumped into Bob Roy, who bought the Continental Mill over in Lewiston . He offered me floor space in there, because he just picked it up. I said , I don't need a whole floor, but I want the bottom floor in there. He says, I promised that part to the Shapiro Boys. I says, you promised what to the Shapiros? I promised the first two floors to the Shapiros. I says to him, Bob, they're not going to move. He says, how do you know. I says, because they don't know anything about it. They bought that factory that they're running right now from C.V. Watson, and they bought it just the way it is, and it's the way it's running , and they haven't done a damn thing to it because, I said , they don't know. There's four brothers, and there isn't a guy in there, I says, that's a shoe man. They are not going to move, that I'm telling you. Now you want me to go up on the third floor. He says, that's my word, I gave them my word. I says, all right. Meanwhile, I'm running out of time so I had to take it. Is said, I want you to promise me that I can take that whole hundred and some-odd thousand feet there, but I'm going to partition it off, I says, but I want it kept open for me. I want your word, that all the wings and everything else will be left vacant, and I'll take them as I expand, because I'll be expanding . He says, you got a deal. And that's where I started in 1961 . Further on from that, while I was working there, and I now moved over the week of the fourth, and I got over there, everything was fine. (Aside : shut it off). (Taping paused.)"
"AL:","Go ahead."
"JF:","I'm back now with Koss Shoe for a moment, all right? The process, another shoe, we had to open up another factory because we were making Goodyear welts in the main factory, and down at the end of the street we opened up another factory making cement shoes, men's cements. And this went along for quite awhile, and I got tired of walking from one building to the other to go examen, see what's going on . So maybe out of a lack of becoming lazy from going up and down from one place to the other and walking around, I got a hold of Herb Callahan, who was a contractor, and I said, how about building on an addition onto this building, so I can bring it over. And not only that, I can get rid of all the, I don't need all these executives from over there, all the foremen from the packing, this and that, and these guys in here, and I can save on the overhead. And that's what I did. Anyways, we built on the addition onto the main building of Koss Shoe, and now I assimilated everything and brought it into the Koss Shoe main building, and that was it. Even prior to that, we had some rubber plants there, the mills were so big that I had them drop it there, and I built the building around the mill. I'm jumping all over the place here."
"AL:","That's okay."
"JF:","Anyways, I got that, I built that and I put them all together over there. Now I'm going back to, I'm going to go over to myself. I then gave him the notice, as I mentioned before, that I was getting through, and I went over to Continental Mill, where I finally, after I got done with growing up a little bit and putting things together the way I wanted them , went over, and then, maybe about six to seven months later, I said six months, might have been nine that I was running back and forth doing his, and I got to get through. Then finally, after awhile, about two or three months perhaps, I got a call from Koss and he wanted to know if he could talk to me. I says, yeah, anytime you want. And I said, you can come over here, and he says, I'd rather have you come over here. I said, you feel safer on your grounds, I said , I'll be there. Anytime you want, and I went over. He said to me, I'd like to, let's see if I can make a deal with you. And I said, what kind of a deal you want to make? So he says, I need you. I says, now you 're hurting me, I says, I did everything I possibly could, I says, I hurt myself physically. Joe, I says, just so I wouldn 't hurt you. There isn't any, I never hired any help from you. And they've been instructed, I says, I thought maybe that's what you wanted to talk about, that somebody did come in and they hired and I didn't know anything about it. Because they've been instructed. And, I says, and believe me, I'll throw them right through the window if I find out if that's what they did. I don't want you hurt, I wouldn 't hurt you. I stayed away from making the type shoes you make, completely altogether. I don't want to, I wouldn 't even go into it. So he says, no that isn't what I want. I want you to come in and give me just an hour a day. I says, thanks for the left handed compliment, but I says, Joe, I couldn't do enough for you in one hour, I'm not a genius. I'm ambitious, I like it, I says, you want to know something . You know it as well as I, I'm not interested in the money. I love the work. I love it. Some guys don't. I look at them, how can you be lazy. What the hell are you going to accomplish in life . Where the hell's the challenge for you, mentally. For God sakes, think of yourself, think of your fam ily, think of something. What are you going to do with your life, go around , drink beer, I says, you can 't. But I said , I can't do it. He said , then give me two hours. I said, oh , here we go. I got my own business Joe, I said, I can 't do you any, you got two sons. He says, yeah , you can have them. I said , that isn't nice . Give them an opportunity. He says, I gave you an opportunity, I gave you my oldest one. Yes, you were afraid , you said to me, originally, and I'll repeat the words to you, I don't want you to touch him , I'll take him under my wing. I says, that's your son , good luck to you . I don't blame you, I said, but that only lasted two weeks. Then you came to me, I'll tell you what Jerry, will you do me a favor. What? Will you take him under your wing . I said , wait a minute Joe, you're talking about your son . He says, yeah , will you take him under your wing. Only on one condition , yeah. You leave him alone, and what I say to him goes. If I tell him to get the hell out of here, he's going to get the hell out of here. We got a deal? He says, we got a deal. I said , okay, then you leave him alone. Now you go tell him , send him in here, I want to talk to him., I says And I talked to him. You sit down there Eddie. You go down to the tracks, you're hanging around with the wrong crowd, this is number one. I'm not your father. But if you say, and you do the wrong thing, and you don 't listen to me, I'll kill you . You remember that. And if you think I can't do it, try me, okay. I'm running your father's business for you , so you can have something. So you can have something, not me, you . I'm not afraid of life, but you better be afraid of it. You better learn. I want you to stick to me like wallpaper. You follow me wherever I go, and don't you open up your mouth. You learn from me. And if I say something , don't you try to correct me. Don't you open up your mouth. And you stay away from the track. I don't want any of those bums around here. And if you got a habit of going to any barrooms, stay out of them. I'll buy you the drinks if you want to, okay. You 'll drink with me when I drink. You got a deal? He says, you got it. I said , okay. Now, he says, I'm going out. You stay with me, I said. You sit right on your ass right there, and when I move you move. Because I don't stay in the office all day, I'm out in the plant. I don't even need a foreman, whether you know it or not, okay. I said , (unintelligible), I am. So anyways, that lasted for I don't know how long, maybe about two weeks, three weeks, and that was the end of that show. After that, it went on. Now, he's got another son there, a younger one, Herbie, and he came along into the show there too. He's going to say, so he says to me again, I'm going to put him on the road . I said , be my guest, do whatever you want, he's your son, you take him . I said, you didn't do too good with the other one. He said , neither did you. I said, I'm not his father, I said, you brought him up wrong in the beginning. I said , he doesn't listen to anybody. Does he listen to his mother? He says, okay. I said, it's a different story, I said, I feel sorry, I can't do anything. I got enough running here, and worrying about my own life, I said, I got my own son . This guy was just born at the time. I said , I got my own headaches. I said, what happens, I don't know. Maybe I'll be good, maybe I'll be worse than you , but I got to depend on his mother, she's a good woman . She'll do it. I can 't. I don't know what it is to bring up a kid. I'm interested in myself. I know my weaknesses, I said, I don't know how to show my love. I don't. I can tell you I love you very much, or you 're gorgeous, this and that, very nice. But I can 't. Some guys can hold hands, this and that. I don't hold hands with anybody. I didn't hold hands with my wife , when we walked down. My son, he used to kid us all the time, he says, you know, I never seen you do this, or do that. He said, other guys do. I said, it's not me Lenny, I don't know, maybe I'm bashful or something, I don't know what it is. I just can 't, I says, my father was that way too. I says, it's just maybe a family trait, I don't know. Anyways, we come back now, I'm back in the business, I go in the business. He's offering me to come in and run it, I can't do it, I'm not going to do it, I'm not going to mislead you . I want time for myself a little bit now. I got it, I finally see something ahead of me that I like. I says, anymore than when I go on, I used to make deals with my wife, don't make any arrangements for me, please, don't make any social arrangements for us. And we had a big crowd , we used to get together weekends, and everybody was in this one's house or that one's house. Big gang. They're all gone now. I outlived them all, wonderful. I haven't got a friend in the world now. Not that you had friends then, these are social friends. Maybe I never let anybody get close to me. I don 't know. If I say to you , you're wonderful, boy, that's the biggest compliment I could give you . It is. I just, certain things I can 't express. But anyways, but I'm a real crybaby on top of that. Maybe they go together. I got into this business, from that point on . As I'm sitting there one day, there was a fellow in town here that, he used to promote the fights there, and his son was some councilman. Not a councilman, but he was I think a representative up in Augusta . Promoted fights."
"AL:","I can't think of the name. I almost think I know who you 're talking about."
"JF:","And his son was in politics."
"AL:","I can't think of the name."
"JF:","And then he got a job, oh my gosh , it's on the tip of my tongue . Anyway, he got a job as the industrial developer for the town of Bethel. And he came down to my factory one day, sat down to tell me about it. I says, no kidding, I says, I'm very happy to hear it, I says, that's nice. He used to promote the fights here. Gosh darn it. Anyways, maybe one of these moments out there it will come back to me. He says, I want you to do me a favor, you can do it. Why don't you open up a little factory up in Bethel. What do you mean , just like that, I open up a little factory? What for. He says, I got a job Jerry, up there, he says, I'm supposed to be the industrial developer for the town of Bethel. I said, what do you want from me. I'm not going to move. I like the setup here. Not only that, I'm getting older, I haven't got the energy now for that. Bad enough I got to run my own business. So he says, well, think of some little thing then. Do me a favor. Well, make a long story short, I did him a favor. He talked me up, because there was a doctor, what's his name, up in Bethel, they own this little garage up there, and his brother. And he said the guy went bankrupt or something, anyways, they moved out, or what ever the heck it was. Look, he said, and they want me to develop for this town of Bethel. Anyways, to make a long story short, I said, I don't even know what the hell to make up the re. I said , there's no shoe people up there, they don't know anything about it, and I said, it means I got to start from scratch and break everybody in, in making shoes? Stitches, cutting. You can do it. You can do it. Well, I'd have to start with something, I says, that there isn't too much knowhow, I says, that you got to get in there, that I can have a couple of boys go up there. Let me kick it around. He said, okay, he said , I'll give you a few days. I said, all right. I come home and I said, now this is on my mind, I don't even tell my wife what's going on there, I never told her anything about the business anyway. Went on, went on, went on. Anyways, two days later, he's back down to the plant. What do you say, he says, what do you say, you want to take a ride up there and take a look at it? All right, come on. When we rode up there, well, I never been to Bethel, I don't remember even going to Norway. And whenever I had to go anywhere I never went north , I always went south, because up here, it was the end of civilization. Then I'm going back into civilization , I go back. So I figure , well, I want to go back where there's people. You get frost bitten up there. So I go up to Norway. I says, where the hell is this place, I says, we're riding , and we keep on going, I said, where are you going. Are you going to Canada? So he says, no, no, no, we're almost there. I says, about twenty-five, thirty miles past, on the other side of Norway. So we get there, there's a building there, across the railroad tracks, and right on the other side there, there's a building there. He said, come on , we'll go in and have a cup of coffee, that's Martha's. All right, we went into Martha's. He says, you know, everything, this Martha comes around , older woman, she was older than me. And she says, I got some nice fresh blueberry pie. I said, hey, you know, this is delicious, yeah. You got a little ice cream you want to put on that. You got any ice cream? Sure. She put it on, I sat there. I said , you know, this is a nice little place here. She says, yeah. So he says, you know, he may be opening up a plant next door. I says, what are you talking about? She says, oh, that would be wonderful. It's about time they got something around in this town here to wake them up. So I says, well then maybe I better talk to you because he's not too fam iliar with this town . You got a lot of girls up here, I says, that can sew? She says, oh yeah . How about fellows, you got any men around here, outside of being lumberjacks. That I'm sure you got. But anyway, making a long story short, everything, I'm making a long story short. Anyways, I come back and I open up a moccasin factory, making moccasins with the rawhide lacing going through there. And I think within two or three months I had about a hundred and fifty-five, fifty sixty people there, a hundred and some-odd ."
"AL:","Really?"
"JF:","Yeah . Working, men, women, cutting, had them up there. And I used to hear, my wife says to me, you know something . What. I'm kind of sorry I married you . Why. I think you're crazy. I says, no, I just love it. She says, are you making money or are you losing money. I says, I just love it, go do me something . I said, I'm making money on it."
"AL:","How long did that moccasin place stay alive?"
"JF:","That stayed alive for about, first of all, I got tired of going back and forth. And when I went up there, it was only for a piece of pie and a cup of coffee. Before I went into the plant, I would go into Martha's and sit down, and I'd say to her, Martha , come over here. What's new next door. She says, well, you know, you got a girl over there, she's married, and the one that you got running the place there, whatever his name was there, he was a deputy sheriff there in the community originally, and I gave him a job running it, and broke him in, what I wanted , what to watch it. And he started playing around with her. I don't know from anything. He got a black eye one day, the husband walked in and belted him. He says, he don't know what happened . The guy come in, and me, like a dummy, I'm believing what he's telling me. I says, no kidding, you don't know the guy? No, walked in, he says, I was working over at the desk Jerry, I was getting these papers, this and that, and he hit me, I got a black eye. I says, and you 're a sheriff. What did you do? Well, I found myself on the floor, I picked up, and he said , he was gone. And that's it? What the hell kind of a cop are you? You got to report, they report to you, people, when they do this. What do you do? Don't you go look for the guy. You mean he walked in, he just hits you. What are you , some kind of a dummy? What are you nuts? Boy, I was like this. So I said, okay, I said, I'm going to go get a cup of coffee. I figure I got to go find out from Martha what the hell's going on around th is town ."
"AL:","What the real story is, right?"
"JF:","Yeah, that's right, she knows everything. I go over, Martha, come here sweetheart. What happened to what's-his-name there, I says, he's got a shiner. She said , didn't you know what was going on . No, I don't know what's going on , I got other things to worry about. What's going on. She said, he's been playing around with the guy's wife. She works for you . She does your- . What's her name. She tells me the name. She says, you know, she's a very attractive girl. I says, there's a lot of pretty girls in there. To me all women are pretty. So she says, yeah , never mind, but he came in and he warned him, he said, the guy's a nice guy. He warned him a couple of times. Okay, thank you Martha. She says, hey, it's not coming from me. I said, what's the matter, you afraid they won't buy a cup of coffee from you, you afraid of that? She said, I'm on your side. I said , okay, I'm not going to tell anybody, don't worry, I'm a big boy. I got to run my own business. I got enough trouble as it is. I don't need this crap. And I go back in there, I said, I tell you what, until this kind of cools down a little bit- by the way, who's Elaine, will you point her out, bring me out in the plant and just, let me face her, and let me look over your shoulder, so I know who it is. He says, okay. We're just talking now, you keep on talking, and we're going out in the plant there. And we went out, I says now, I don't want you looking at her, I don't want you doing anything, I says, I just want you to face me so that I can see her. You keep talking to me. He says, the one that's right over there, right now she's handing out some stuff to somebody, one of the girls on the end over there. Oh yeah , I see her, yeah, yeah , she's stacked pretty good , I says to him . I can see why you 'd be a nut. Your job doesn't mean anything to you, whether it's the city, whoever hired you, who hires you , the state, to be a marshal or sheriff, or whatever you want to call yourself, or a goddam fool? And if you pardon the expression, you can't even keep your fly zipped. You're some smart guy. It looks like I know how to pick a guy, huh . I tell you what, let's walk back into the office now, and I want you to leave, and you'll go down to my plant, and you 'll stay down there for a couple of days. You report down there. Don't you report here any more, until things cool down . Give me a chance to think, okay? Because, I said, I don't think I even scraped the surface. You go down there, I'll have one of my boys come up here to run the joint. You're going back with me. He says, well, I got my car. Then you drive down. What is it, the sheriff's car? You drive down my place, and wait for me. Go in my office, and you go now. Okay, fine. I got on the phone, I called down here, I asked for this fellow, Jerry Pawnell. I said, Jerry, do me a favor, I want you to come up here, I want you to take over, you tell your wife you're going to be working up here for a couple of days, till we get it squared away. He said, okay Jerry. I said, I'm going to be leaving. I'm coming down, I says, you come up here. He says, okay. He left, we swapped, I waited for him to come in though, and then I went back. And I come in here late. My wife says, where you been, she says, I called the plant, they said you were up in Bethel. What are you doing up in Bethel so late? She says, boy, you're going to wear yourself out to nothing . Ah, nothing , some crazy guys. I says, you know Emma, I don't understand guys, I says, they're crazy. You think you're hanging around, you see something in a barroom, I says, the guys act like goddam fools . I don't know, I said, I can 't reform everybody. Anyways, we went down, set him up there, and I got a hold of another fellow that applied for an executive job down here. I said , I got a spot for you up in Bethel. He says, hey, I like Bethel. You do. Yeah. I got a spot for you , you run it. Run it? Yeah, I want you to run it. I don't want any monkeying around . There's some good looking girls up there. There's lot of girls up there. If I had a hundred and fifty , a hundred sixty, I would say maybe a hundred and ten of them were women, female, and the rest of them were male. So you can see, you're exposed to all of this, and you got some pretty farm girls up there, too, if you 're looking at it from that angle. So he came up. I says, you make sure you behave yourself, because that's why this other one is going to be bounced. He said, okay. Now, I said to the sheriff, I call him the sheriff, I says, I'm going to give you a couple of weeks pay, but that's it. You 're all through. You asked for it, you got it. I hope it's a lesson, I hope you learn something from it. I'll keep quite, and I'm sure you will too. It won't come from me, and you can use my name for a reference anytime you want. I'll never belittle anything. I said, if they don't ask me a pertinent question. He says, you mean about that? I said, no, nobody's going to ask me that. I says, the key question you want to always remember is this, if you were going to hire him , would you? I says, think about it. If I'm ever asked that, I can 't lie. I might be evasive, but I won 't lie. He said, okay, thanks a lot. I says, you take care of yourself. I hope you learned a lesson. He says, I did, thank you . He says, you 're some guy. I said, yeah , so are you, but you just did a job on yourself. Anyways, that was the end of that. And that lasted for maybe three years, and I got tired of going back and forth , and back and forth , and finally I figured , oh, the heck with that, and I gave it up. I said to my wife, I said , I'm giving this one up. She says, you know what, you 're nuts. She says, you know how long that's going to last. Watch , you 'll open up something else some other place, because you can 't stay still. But anyways, that was the story there."
"AL:","Did you close that down, or did somebody else take it over?"
"JF:","No, I closed it down . Any more than myself when I got out of business over here. They wanted me to go, you know, they come over, you got these groups that want to buy you . But they're just investors, you know, guys from New York came in, this and that, fine. But they want me to stay on for five years to run it. What the hell am I getting out of here for? I'm not, no way, boy. And the same thing I said to my son, I had him in there, I said Lenny, you know I'm not going to stay here all the time. If you want it, you got it. He says, I'll be very honest with you . I said , I hope you're honest with me. He says, I'm scared . Good, good, that's good, sure you're scared . But maybe this will help you . I'll stay here every day, I'll work for you, and I said, I'll work for you at the right price, you don't have to pay me. I'll come in here, I'll read the Wall Street Journal as I do, this and that. I'll be right here, and you can use me for an encyclopedia if you want, whatever the heck you want. I won 't bother anybody. Just leave my desk there as it is, I says, and I'll just come up here. I might come up with your mother here, and we'll sit here and we'll talk, have a cup of coffee , bring in some coffee. I said, okay, we got a deal? Give me three more months. Okay, you got three months, I'm not pushing you , think about it. Three months gone by, I says, hey Lenny, it's four months, not three months. I moved it late, four weeks later, but I want to talk to you. You know, Lenny, I'm up in my seventies already, I says, I want to travel with your mother. I haven't been fair to her. I want to go travel the world, travel around, I says, I want to see these things too. He says, I don't blame you, why don't you go ahead. No, don't play games with me now, I want an honest answer. I want to retire. Not the way you want me to retire. I want to retire the way I want to retire, when I know this is running safely and you got it and you can run it. I'll give you all the help you want, all the help you want, I just don't want you to get carried away. I want you to know the difference between right and wrong, and how to judge people, and I don't want you to, I hope you learn something from me, don't ever let anybody read you. You 're always nice to everybody. You don't have to holler at anybody, you don't have to swear at anybody. I don't like foul language. It doesn't mean anything , it only belittles you. This isn't a beer joint. So you act, if you want respect, the first thing is you got to respect yourself. Don't expect the next guy to do something for you, you can 't do for yourself. So now, what do you want, another week to think about it, another two weeks to think about it. These are big decisions for you . I don't know why. If my father said this to me, and he did , and I gave him the answer right off the bat. I don't want it. Because I was too close to it. He was an importer, and exporter. He traveled the world. He was in Africa. He was all over. It was nice. Now I want to do the same thing , I want to take your mother with me, I want to go to China, I want to go everywhere. I want it. I had a boat. I used to go out. Somebody says to me, hey, you have to be crazy. What are you going back to work for, there's a life there, you go out. I used to go out, up the Kennebec River, I says, I got a cabin cruiser, went out, used to enjoy it all summer long. I says, I love it, I was brought up around water. You see, I wanted you to have part of it, I says, but you , if you 're going to go around drinking beer with a bunch of bums, you're going to be a bum. And you're judged by the company you keep. Why, because you think I'm picking up the tab for you? Unh-unh, you 're going to work for it. But I'll work for you for nothing if you take it over. I don't know where, I think if my father made a deal like that to me, I said , to be honest with you , maybe he did make a deal like that with me, but I didn't pick it up. You got to give me a yes or no. Well, when I want to make a long story short, he says no. Okay, it's your decision , what do you want to do. He said , I'd rather teach. I said, okay, that's all right, if that's what you want, I can 't argue with you. He says, what are you going to do. I'm going to sell it, or break it up. I put it together, I'll take it apart. That doesn't scare me. I says, that's it, Lenny, I'm in my seventies. Yeah , you're young , he said . Lenny, stop kidding yourself. You can only live so long. Some guys live five years, ten years longer than the other guy, and sooner or later it catches you. Soon as you 're born , you're ready to die. I says, I don't like to sound that way, I don't like to talk that way, I says, I like to look at the bright side of life, I says, and I want you to be that way. But anyways, he passed it up, and then you get the offers coming in. And then they want you to stay there. What the hell I want to stay there for? I'm getting out because I want to get out. I've already had enough of it. Buy it. Well, you're not going to steal it. Buy it, whatever it's worth , here. Get your accountant, come on in, and let them go through the books and give me a figure ."
"AL:","This was in the 1980s?"
"JF:","Later than that. It was right up into the, I think 1990 I closed up, 1990, yeah."
"AL:","So, your shop was on the later end of the closings, really. Didn't a lot of them happen in the eighties? JF : Yeah , a lot of them went up. They already were winding down. We went through some tough times. But surprisingly, we were busy even when things were tough. I didn't even know they were tough , you know, because we were busy all the time. And I had some good boys around me out on the road too, I had a couple of goddam good salesmen. There's Leo DeLori (sounds like), good boy. I had to call, even when I left Joe Koss, he gave me, talk about left handed compliments, he says to me, oh, I think the way I gave it to him wasn't very nice because I got a little bit angry at the time. To me, the space, when I put the offices together, I moved them from Hutchins Street over to the Barker Mill, and I could also, with me, I never want to lose any time, so it was always done over a weekend or whatever it is. So I broke up the cutting room , brought them over there. They worked up till Friday nights and I says, you fellows report over at Barker Mill Monday morning, when you come into work, go over there, don't come over to this building, you go over there. It'll be ready for you . Machines will all be up for you. And it was. I got hold of Pete Boduc there, and everything was done over the weekend. And then even, what's his name, Roy Snow, he used to work for Charlie Curry (sounds like), the electrician, he went into business for himself and I was his first customer and I put him in, I said this and that. He said, how many men do I need. You got to keep pace with me, I said to him, wiring the other building, you know, go on, when I was moving them over. And it was something else. When I finally had the cutting and stitching room over there, now, I says, we're going to take, I told him originally, we'll take two weeks off before I break the heavy machinery from the lasting room and the making room and bring it over, I says, because then I'm ready, now I got the lasting and making room , I says, and the finishing room , and the packing room , I said, now it's taking the other half of the factory and moving it all over. End of Side A SideB"
"AL:","We're now on Side B. Okay, keep going , and so you brought the other half over, the the lasting room ."
"JF:","The lasting room , brought the other half over. I says, it's going to take, because this is already not a weekend job, so I said, it's going to take a lot of time coming over. So I says now, but however, I'm ready. So he says, I thought you said you're going to give me three weeks. I says, I'm sorry, but I don't want to interrupt my production from the factory, I says, so I'm a liar. We're going to go in two weeks. He says, Jesus, I haven't got the manpower. I says, go hire them, what are they lumpers? Go hire these guys, that's all they are. He's supposed to be an electrician . Hire them, go get some lumpers, bring in the labels, and the, whatever the hell you need , bring it in. But, I says, go hire some guys, they're around. He says, boy, you 're something . I says, yeah , I know I'm something, go ahead. Meanwhile, put up a nice big sign, Roy Snow Electrician, I says, and you 're in business. So anyways, he says, okay, and he went along. He always reminded me about it. He says, you remember. He says, this guy was something. He's going around begging me on the back of, we went over. And anyways, we did move over there, and I got a mover lined up. And to me, office space was the thing that was the least important to me. I could have the girls working on orange crates in the office. But the factory was important. The girls there had to have everything spotless, everything had to be right. The machinery had to be right. Their places had to be clean , this and that. And in the office, forget about it. So I put Koss and myself in one office. He was behind me, I had a desk in front, then the other ones in front. I remember May Estes sitting on the other side, she come in . And Dave Mangan (sounds like) was the office manager, and he was on the other side. All the girls were around there. Anyways, it was unimportant. It isn't where you made your money, you made your money out in the plant. I always felt that way. And I didn't work with over staff. You go into a lot of factories, in a lot of the shoe factories, and you got an office laid out with girls, you might have twenty-five girls there, you don't even need half of them. You don't even need , you only need a tenth of what you got in there to do the work. Because they stand around , some of the girls, they're watching the (unintelligible), you know, you see them going around, you know, cleaning. Stay there because you get in trouble. Either that or your going to be chewing on something, you end up getting fat. You know, you work. But th is is what goes on . I came in , one fellow gives me a notice, that's how I wasn't that nice, old-tempered all ready. He's sitting behind me, Koss, and this and that, and one of my foremen had given me his notice that he was going to get through, AI Hood, in the making room . Where you going AI? He says, I'm going up to Hazzard Shoe, up in Gardiner. That's your prerogative, I said, I guess you know what you 're doing . Let me wish you luck. When do you want to get through . He said , I'll give you a two week notice. That's very nice of you, fine , I said , I'll tell you what, I'll give you two weeks pay, you can leave now. I don't like notices. I had a block always, and I do to this day, if you give me your notice, you 're no good to me from now on. What are you going to do for me now, for two weeks. Are you concerned about this not being right, and not, th is and that, or you didn't put it in the file it in the right place, or you didn't do this. I mean, you 're getting through , so you're just walking around talking with the people around there, this and that, yeah, I'm getting done. Oh, you take care of some of your work that you feel it was important, but your heart isn't in it, you 're all through. So don't do me any favors, go, go now. And that's what I always did, I never kept anybody that gave me a notice. And not too many of them that gave me notices in all the years, no matter where I was. This is funny, because I treated them like people, like I wanted to be treated ."
"AL:","Maybe they heard that you let people go as soon as they gave notice."
"JF:","Maybe, you may have a point there. But no, I had very few people go. If they wanted to get through and were offered anything, this I've had happen to me, they had come in and gave me a notice. He didn't give me a notice, but he says, I have an opportunity of leaving and I've been offered a job, get through for more money. I go, oh yeah, is it in town? You get an answer. This one happened, no, it's not in town. I said, well I have a foot up, haven't I? So he looked at me, he says, what do you mean? If you take a job, this other job that's been offered you , are you going to move your family, sell your house? Are they paying you that kind of money? I said, I'm just curious. I'm not going to try to, I don't want you to stay here, because I'm going to say, what did they offer you and I'm going to give you more money. I'm not an auction block. You see, because I have no fear, I want you to know that. Because what you are doing for me, I can do for myself, so I don't need you. It's just that I don't want to work that hard . You still want to get through? You want to th ink about it a little bit? I don't want you to stay here if you feel that you have to. If you really want to get through, go ahead. Well, I, you know, I've been with you, you got, my mother works here, and my wife works for you . Yeah, taking the whole family with you? They all moving. Your mother moving down there too. It's all right. Good luck to you. Now maybe I don't want you, even if you decide to stay here. So you take your family and go ahead. You think I'm going to close up. Do you really think that? I wish you a lot of luck. I don't want to stand in your way of progress and you getting ahead . But you want to know something? I th ink you 're making a big mistake. How much did they offer you. I think it was maybe twenty-five dollars a week more. Do you want to say here, or do you want to leave. He said , I'd rather stay with you , he says, because I've learned so much from you. I says, well, thanks. He said , you're really some guy, he said, I want to stay with you. Okay, well make up your mind . It's your mind , not mine. You want to stay? Yeah, I want to stay. Now, don't you feel like a jackass? How do you know I want to keep you now. You see, you 're playing games now. He says to me, I'll stay, I'm sorry, I want to apologize. It's okay, now you got a raise for twenty five dollars, okay? He says, you 're some guy. I said , no, think the next time before you do something . You got your whole family, including your mother, who's a widow now, I says, she's living alone, got her own house, keeping it up, she makes good pay here . I says, you 're going to hurt everybody. I said, you made the right decision , good luck to you . He says, thank you. I says, I've already forgotten it. But anyways, this is what goes on. And you say they wanted, even from me, to go on , you have an office, to stay there when you get out. Come in, I says, no, stay there for five years You know, this is, you always got to deal, somebody said , well, at least give us three years. I don't give you anything. I don't need you. I'm not looking for the money. I'm getting out, period , go do me something. I want to spend some time with my wife, I'm an old man now, I want to get the hell out of here. I want to go with her, I want to spend some time down in Florida. That's as far away I'm going to go, I said, big deal. In my old age, I got to go to Florida, with all the old cronies. So anyways, this is what happened . So anyways, I sold it all off, piecemeal, here, there, and bye, Charlie, it was 1990, that's when I got out, closed up shop, and left. That was the end of it. Then I turned around and I says to my wife, now, I used to go down there, I don't know if you're familiar with Florida at all, at the Fontainebleau Hotel down there in Miami, big hotel, this is where I used to go down. I was very friendly with the fellow that was the manager, because I used to make shoes for him , make them up for him. Made them for Frank Sinatra, by the way, too. I made some personal shoes for him. And I remember Doctor, here in Portland, he was the heart specialist up there, Givits (sounds like), at the Maine Medical, Bernie Givits, 9-1 /2 D, he wore. Anyways, when they moved over to the heart center over there, I went over and I said to him - in fact, his son is the head of the, he's the head cardiologist at the Brigham and Young Hospital in Boston. That's where my son was born, in that hospital, Brigham and Young. Anyways, Givits, when he moved over to the new building there, I was down there, and he says, hey, I still got a pair of shoes you made for me, I haven't even worn them. Because I used to stamp their shoe inside, made especially for Dr. Givits. This was the lining inside, in the shoe. Especially for Dr. Givits. Anyways, I says well, if I had known that, I would have made you up a few more pair, but you know, with things going on, I haven't seen you for awhile. He says, Jerry, I'm going to be leaving . I said, you just moved over here. He says, that's all I wanted to do, was move the heart section over here, he says, and get good boys down here. He says, I moved them over, and I'm going to go. He come over, he gave my wife a hug, gave me a hug. He says, you know something . I says, what. He said, I'll be coming back in a year, this and that. I says, hey Bernie, why not be a smart guy. You 're retiring , you're getting out of it, go fishing . Get outta here. You 've seen enough heartaches in your life. Get away from it. Enough is enough. What do you got to prove, coming in here. You going to hang around. I says, when I quit, I hadn't closed up yet at the time, I says, when I quit, I'll stay away from it. I'll forget even how to tie a shoe, I guarantee you. I says, you can 't go on. He said, well yeah . I said, I'll start all over again on something else. But from that point on, I used to make shoes for this guy, Frank Margulies, was his name, he was manager of the Fontainebleau. The hardest part was getting a plane reservation , because we used to go in there for a weekend . So go get a plane out of here, out of Maine to get the hell down there to Miami. So once you got it, I could go down , no reservation , no nothing. And I come in, and I call from down the lobby, I call upstairs to his office. He says, where are you . I says, down in the lobby. He says, oh for Christ sake, he'd say to me, what are you doing here. Why don't you call up and make some reservations. I says, why. He says, we haven't got a damn room here. I said , then I'll sleep in your office. Don't have to worry about it. And one time I got stuck. He had to get his limo out, and drove me into, to get a hotel in Miami, the city of Miami, put me up. Soon as I got in there, I got a call, he says, Jerry, get the hell back here, I got a room for you. said, okay, fine, I says, send the car out. He says, for Christ sakes, grab a cab. Anyways, the hotel there, business went down . And the funny part is, I like that hotel, by the way, because you had everything going on. Jackie Gleason had his birthday party there, there was Bishop Sheen that was there at his party. Oh my gosh, everybody you 've ever seen in the newspaper was there. Terrific. I remember going up in the elevator with Eddie Fisher there, he's singing, and he's half pie-eyed . He had the girl with him , he's singing to her, this and that. I said , why don't you do your singing downstairs in the lounge, down there where you belong. So he says, you don't like my singing. I says, why, you like it? Anyways, I got off on the floor there anyways, and we went to, we went down there and I would go down six months. Now, when I sold it, from '90 on, so we got a condo up in Hollywood area, the Hemispheres. They were big, they had four big units that were right on the beach. And that's between Ft. Lauderdale, and Miami. So it was perfect. So you know, you can go between one and the other, and that's how I'd spend one way, six months the other. When I did that, however, everybody used to say, they're going over to Ft. Myers on the west coast. I never been to the west coast. So I said to my wife, you know something, let's play the game smart. Let's spend a week over there on the west coast, see what it's like. So we went over to Sarasota and checked into the Four Seasons. I knew somebody that was in the real estate business over there, and I made an appointment to meet him. He said, okay, and he gave me the date when he goes down . So I said , okay, fine. But then I left, there was a message for me, that he won't be there until the weekend . I says, oh well, big deal, I'll look around myself. I got over there, it's different. I'm used to the, I was used to the night life, I like the entertainment, I like the shows, the plays. You had ice hockey, you had basketball if you wanted it, you had everything you wanted. You had the Jackie Gleason Theater that was further on down, down there, they had one set up. No matter where you were, between Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, you had all kinds of entertainment. You had gambling if you wanted, real gambling. You get on the boat, you go out for the day for gambling, they go out past the three mile limit, so now you can do all the gambling you want, and then they'd come back for the evening. You had everything, everything was always rolling, rolling, rolling , whatever you felt like doing. You want the sun, plenty of sun, you're right on the beach. So this is, we got a condo down there at the Hemispheres and we'd stay there for six months, come back here for six months. And my wife didn't even want this. We were living over on Aaron Drive, before they built the Auburn, there was all those condos over there, you know, those apartments. There wasn't anything there. Just the one, what's his name that built the Pioneer Plastics, Mr. Aaron. He built it for his executives, that one building. There was only four apartments in there, big apartments, they're nice. So I sold my house over in Lewiston, and I rented that apartment over there from him, and he was my next door neighbor, we were both on the top floor there, there's only two floors and he's on one side and I was on the other. Nice big apartments. And then he sold out and somebody else bought it, and I said , you know, they don't know how to take care of it. Then these apartment started going up, and going up, and apartments started to build up. Said to my wife, well, I think we're going to move, and get out, and she didn 't want to move. She says, this way, they're only a headache. I said , building apartments, these condos over here, come on we'll try it. We don't like it, we'll move out. I said maybe, I says, I'll tell you what, you want to live down in Florida? I wasn't retired. I'm getting ahead of myself, because that I said later. Anyways, we came over here. This wasn 't even built, so I bought the land and they put it up. I wanted one way down there, so the, what's his name that was the realtor, said to me, you're going to wait down there, these are the ones that are going up. Not only that, you're on top of the hill, everything drains down . I said , oh yeah , tell me, how do they go? Well , you got the units going on, this one's a little bigger than this. I said, I want a bigger one. She says, okay, fine. I says, how many bathrooms? You got one. I says, can I do what I want inside before you build it. She says, yeah. You got the land . I said, if I want to put in two bathroom , can I put in two bathrooms, I said, I'm getting older, so when we come in , my wife goes to one and I go for the other one. She started laughing, you know, she says, yeah , you can do whatever you want to. Fine, so that's what we did. So we put it all together the way we wanted it. Like I put in stuff I want, like all the other ones got pine in the kitchen there, over here we got oak. I got Formica top in there. So whatever we wanted, we put in . Any more than this picture over here, behind you, I bought that from where we were boating up in Booth Bay, Charles Groupie painted that. He taught at Yale, art. His mother and his father are both artists. What's his name , the movie actor there, got a couple of his paintings out there in Hollywood . Anyways, I saw that, and we walked in , you know, put it in the back, I bought it up there. It's okay. I happened to go down, I wanted to replace that one over there, wh ich is- this one I bought at the airport, we bought it at the airport down there in Palm Springs, Palm Beach."
"AL:","I have one last question ."
"JF:","Ask me anything you want."
"AL:","Then we'll have to end for today. How did you come to make shoes for Frank Sinatra, do you remember? How did you - ?"
"JF:","I think, one of the salesmen bumped into, not him , but his right-hand man , whoever he was. And they wanted , they had these junkets, you know, the planes you go out gambling, wherever it is. Well, there was one that he was involved in , Frank Sinatra, that was going to Turkey. So I got the call, you know, hey, he's got a junket that's going to Turkey for four days. He says, get your wife, he says, and go out, and he gave me all the dates, this and that. I says, what are you, nuts. I'm not going to drop everything . It's very nice, thank you very much, I says, I'm not going to go anywhere. That's the same thing, like we made some shoes for the guy over on , I may have told you that, over in , one of the Arabs there, they owned Filoh. You've heard of the F-i-1-o- h, Filoh athletic stuff. You'll see it on the shirts, the Filoh. Well that's these Arabs, and one of the sons went into the shoe unit, and they were buying shoes and putting it in. So they bought these shoes from us, we made them for them. We made shoes for Clark Shoes too, of England. Anyways, they bought the shoes, and I don't know them from a hole in the wall , so now I've got the shoes there and I'm not shipping them. I got them all stacked up, all the cases, wouldn't move them out. The salesmen says to me, hey, are the shoes ready, I got a call from what's his name, he's coming over. I said , that's good . I said , look, I don't like doing business with somebody that's out of the country. I says, what the hell, I got to go wait for the money, I don't know what kind of exchange you got or whatever is going on. I know what the price is of the stuff. I says, I've got to have some exchange, I says, going back, I got to know I got it. I'm not going to go whistle Dixie, you know. Anyways, he said well, he's coming over anyways, he said , I'll tell him. I said, tell him, there's not sense lying about it, and I'll go sell the shoes to somebody else. So anyways, he came over, and they come up to the factory, that's good. So they came up to the factory, and he's got a suitcase with him, and puts it down , I introduce him, and we started talking. Nice fellow, well educated. I was talking, how long you going to stay in the States. I'm going to be here for maybe ten days, two weeks. And we talked, and we talked , and we talked . Make a long story short, I've been making a long story short all the time, he says, why don't you come over, be our guests, you and your wife, he says, for a week or ten days. I says well, thank you very much, that's very nice of you. So I said , if that's the case, you know, we always had a bottle of liquor, I says, let's all drink to that. Anyways, we turned around, and the salesmen says to me, he grabs my arm you know, he says, no, we 'll pass on that Jerry. I says, okay. And I look at him, and I'm puzzled. I really am, I'm puzzled , I guess the expression was on my face . And the fellow says, I forget his name now, anyways, Arab name, anyways, he says, Jerry, we don't drink liquor. Oh , I said, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you in any way. I says, I'm not a drunk myself, I use it here, a cocktail once in a while, that's all. He says, no, we don't touch it at all, he says, it's against our religion . I says, is that why your inviting me to go over there, I says, as soon as I walk off the plane you'll hand me a bottle of booze, and then wham, you'll cut off my head? He says, no, I wou ld never do that, no, no, no, don't say that. Anyways, we talked. He had a bag, something like that, and he unzips it, and he says, where do you want me to put it. I said , put what. And it's all money, cash , American money. And I'm looking. Well, did you ever see seventy thousand dollars all stacked all together? I didn't. I never seen ten thousand dollars, I never seen five thousand dollars all stacked . I never worked in a bank. I'm looking at it, and I'm looking at him, and maybe like a little kid, you know, you're amazed . I said, what the heck is that? He says, I want to pay for the shoes. You do? Yeah . He said, you didn't know me, you don't know the fami ly, and I can understand, he says, this is the first order. So I want to in American money, he says, it's all there, have your girl count it. I said, my girl count it, I'll need the whole office force counting. I said , well that's good. Stop it, he says to me, leave it alone, will you. It's all paid for, now give me the shipping papers, he says, and move my shoes out, and I'll give you the address where I want them shipped. I said, okay, they'll go out tonight. He says, okay, that's all I want. He says, and I hope th is is the beginning of a long relationship , he said, and I still say, I'd like to see you and your wife come over, you 'll enjoy it, he says, you 'll have a hell of a good time. You'll enjoy it, it will be something new. I said, I never been out of the country, I'll go in there like a little kid in a candy shop. He says, come on over, I'd like to see you . He says, you 're some guy. I says, never mind, I'm some guy. But anyways, that was the story there. So as I say, these are the things that go on that you can reminisce and go through. I've had a wonderful life actually, I have no regrets. I can 't think of anything. I haven't maybe been nice to the extent that I want to be, because, as I said to you before, I found it very hard sometimes to really express my love fully . In other words, I'll say, like my wife always said, to know you is to love you . This was her favorite saying."
"AL:","Well , I thank you so much for your time."
"JF:","It was all a monologue. I don't know what the hell I got on there. I told you to"
