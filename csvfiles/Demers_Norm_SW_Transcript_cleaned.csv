"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) January 17, 2009 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Workers Oral History Project at Museum L-A. The date is Saturday, January 17th, 2009. I'm at the home of Norm Demers in Lewiston , Maine, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. Norm, could you start just by giving me your full name?"
"ND:","It's Norman R. Demers."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"ND:","I was born in Providence, Rhode Island, March 27, 1927."
"AL:","Is that the area in which you grew up?"
"NO:","We moved to Maine in 1938, I was eleven years old then."
"AL:","Where in Maine did you live?"
"ND:","We first lived in Auburn for a short time , maybe six months, and then my folks had a house built on Fairmont Avenue in Lewiston and we moved into that. I went, at that time, to Holy Family School. Later I went to Lewiston High, where really, during that time, I had my first experience with shoe factories. The summer vacation after my freshman year, I applied, and got a job, at Lumbard Watson, on Main Street in Auburn, in the cutting room , doing all kinds of jobs, training, which developed into sorting leather, and cutting. What I thought was going to be a summer job, because this was war time , and help was going to the ship yards so the shoe factories were a little short of help, so I stayed on and worked after school, afternoons, Saturdays, and sometimes at night. So that was my beginning with the shoe industry."
"AL:","What was Lewiston like while you were growing up, in terms of how it's different today?"
"ND:","Well, I guess the obvious difference was the people that we have from the outside now. I say that, reserving how I'm going to say it, but the only black boy was a great guy, who was in my class in high school. He was president of his class, and he was a musician, and he ended up being a teacher of blind children , teaching them the piano, in Boston. So it tells you what kind of people there were. I guess that's the biggest change. Of course, Lisbon Street and Main Street, which is where, as youngsters, we hung out, so to speak, obviously those have been major changes, such as there were in any city in America. It think those are the biggest changes. The relationship between Lewiston and Auburn , I think that still exists. There's a competitiveness there, in the schools, in the football team and the other teams, you know. Those were existing then, and I think they still do."
"AL:","Was downtown Lewiston , the business district, was that more popular? It was more of a center for shopping."
"ND:","Oh yeah, well, it was popular too. First of all, there was no malls, so to speak. So young people just walked the streets downtown on a Saturday to see who you might meet, people you knew in the stores. Some of them were just friends, and you would visit with them while you were there, things like that. Lisbon Street, at least for me, was very popular, because even though I was brought up on Fairlawn Avenue, which was a good distance, the likes of which , frequently, I had to walk, or the bus, or the trolley, but that was during the transition between trolleys and buses. But no, that was popular. There were ice cream parlors, and pool rooms that young guys frequented."
"AL:","And what brought your parents to Maine?"
"ND:","At the time, it was work, it was employment. My mother had two sisters who lived in Auburn, all of whom originally come from New Brunswick, and I think the youngest one was getting married . We were living in Rhode Island , and they came up for the wedding on a weekend . Alii remember is that when they came back they said , how would you like to live in Maine. It didn't make any difference to me. I don't think it bothered me very much. I think within a week or so, my father, during the weekend here, had met a contractor, who apparently was looking for people. My father said, well let me think about it. That was it. They kept in contact, and we moved here, and he worked for him for a year or so. Over the years, his longest stay was with R.J. Morin , the painting contractor. When R.J. Morin runs an ad in the paper, even today, my father is in that ad . He has a crew, an old crew, and my father is in that ad."
"AL:","That's neat. So that's what he did most of his years."
"ND:","My father was a painter, paper hanger. Very critical, very artistic in his work. He did a lot of work at Poland Spring, in the days of Poland Spring. He did a lot of work at the DeWitt Hotel, which you probably don't even remember."
"AL:","But I've heard of it."
"ND:","It was, the hotel here in Lewiston. People with beautiful homes in Auburn would ask for Shorty, Shorty Demers, that's what they called him. And so he was well respected in what he did. Most of it was paper hanging. That was his thing."
"AL:","In high school, during summer vacation , you had your first experience."
"NO:","My first experience with the shoe industry."
"AL:","And then where did you go from there?"
"NO:","And that went on, see, that was '46, and that went on, I kept, I stayed there for two and a half years, working part time and going to high school. Then in December of my senior year, now the war was really going full guns, so like several others, I quit school and volunteered in the Navy. So I left for the Navy, I was there for nineteen months. When I came back, I went to work almost immediately at what was then North American Phillips Company, I worked there for a couple of years. Just long enough to meet my wife, or the woman who was going to be my wife. Then I got laid off, and of course, here in Lewiston-Auburn , the thing to do, the only other experience I had was in shoes, and I went right to work at Bel Moe as a cutter, as a shoe cutter. And I worked there for seven years. Then in 1956 I was interviewed for a job as a supervisor for the Charles Eaton Company in Richmond. But when I saw the building, when I went for the interview, I saw the building, I really wasn 't sure I wanted to work here, because it was a big old dilapidated wooden building, built in the early 1900s. But the people were very nice, so I took the job and gave it my best shot. My duties continued to grow and change as the years went on. I did all kinds of supervisor jobs of other departments, and then as an assistant manager, and then plant manager, V.P. of manufacturing. In 1963 we built a new building, because every year of course I had to put a budget together, and I'll always remember, it was a family owned company, Mr. Charles Eaton himself, I was putting the budget together, there was a budget, part of the budget, there was insulation and winterizing, and I think we maybe put in ten thousand dollars a year. And I said to him, it doesn't matter, you could put fifty thousand dollars in this building, you 're not going to save it, you 're not going to get your money back. I say, we don't put anything , and we start a fund towards a new building some day. Well I guess I said the right words, because we immediately started looking at opportunities for safe guaranteed loans, for the land, for people, whoever helps you develop this kind of idea . So in 1963, we were on the way. We went in the new building in November of '63."
"AL:","Did you find a building, or you built one?"
"NO:","We built one, with help from the state, and all kinds of different angles. And we kept very busy. Again, as I grew into the business too, I got all kinds of different accounts in there. We got some military work at a time when they needed, because our costs were not as low as the people who had been making military shoes, but there was a surplus of business to be had , and I got some of that at a good time for us. I became, I forgot exactly what year that I was V.P. of manufacturing, but that developed. And then, really in 1973, I became president of the company, and I stayed there for seven years. But in '76 the company got sold. Mr. Eaton was getting along in years, and although I had hoped , and he had said that some day he would sell it to a group of management. Well, that didn't happen. He did get an offer from Colgate Palmolive who, in those years, that period of time, they had a chairman of the board who was interested in developing other opportunities, and he had gone towards the sports world. So he was very active in golf and tennis, and he had alignments everywhere around the world. So we were his shoe manufacturer here. Well , I worked for them for four years, four and a half, and there came a time when I just didn't want to do this anymore. This was not fun anymore. So in 1980 I left, and I did some consulting. I consulted with Rockport, I did a couple of different stints with New Balance, including helping them open a factory in Norridgewock for shoes. But I didn't want to travel to Norridgewock because it was sixty miles away, morning and night. So I went into the leather business and I became a leather broker, or a leather jobber, or what ever you want to call it. So, Demers Leather was born in 1983. I retired in the later nineties and my son kept the business going. But as the shoe industry, which was really the base of our leather business, as the shoe industry moved to China, we just lost the base. And although there was a lot of smaller business that we developed, handbags, and the western trade, there's a lot of horses around this country, all of which need reins, and saddles and the boys need chaps, you know, all kinds of things. But it's not, it's still not as much volume as one shoe factory could get. So that's what happened to Demers' Leather. That was my experience."
"AL:","What year did you close Demers?"
"ND:","It just closed last year. This year, excuse me. Well, last year, '08, just finally locked it up."
"AL:","So, over those years being in the shoe industry, tell me what you observed about the changes and the demand going overseas. How did that affect you at the time you were at Eaton?"
"ND:","Well I think, I suppose I would say that I never expected all of the industry to leave. There was still I guess two shoe factories here in town. But at the time, in the early fifties, I think there were twenty-three union factories in Lewiston and Auburn, plus a few, including Knapp Shoe, that was not union. So that gives you an idea of the depth of the industry in this area. Maine, at that time, was the fourth largest shoe producing state in the country, behind maybe New York and California, and Massachusetts I think. So it was a big impact. Although the movement to Asia by such early companies as Bostonian, Commonwealth Shoe, (unintelligible) had I think three factories in the area, they had one in Gardner, Freeport, and in Lewiston . And I knew the management so when they started to move, you know, you kind of thought, well they'll get their experience. But it developed that then you'd see somebody else move, and you'd see somebody else get bought out and move. It was just a series of things that happened . And then some had to go out because they were no longer competitive, because the price structure changed. And of course now, if there 's nobody training any shoe workers, you know, even if the industry came back, it would be difficult. It was a, the shoe industry was labor intent. You know, one third of the cost of a pair of shoes usually is labor. If you don't have it, it's substantial, if you don't have the business, then you can 't support the labor."
"AL:","And what type of shoes did Eaton make?"
"NO:","Eaton made a lot of different things. They had a smaller part of their distribution that was Charles Chester brand, and those were work shoes and some dress shoes. They were a Goodyear welts, this is the construction. Now when I say Goodyear welts, I thin k the only Goodyear welt factory here in Lewiston was Knapp. And then they made a variety of other shoes but then, as their business climate changed , the brand, Etonic came of age, and we were very heavy in golf shoes. And mostly in high grade golf shoes. And we, at one time in the late seventies, I think we were either number one or two in distribution of golf shoes through the golf pro shops. And I will always remember, when I left Etonic, the guy who was president who was Foot Joy, was a friendly competitor, called me, and he said, you know, he says, the best thing that ever happened to us was when you left Etonic. He says, our business has been great ever since. So that was that kind of relationship that we had. I never would have thought that it would all leave, but they were all , maybe not all , but most of the shoe companies where family owned. They were. Some of it was management owned, like Knapp, Eaton, Fry Boot in Massachusetts, Diamond Shoe was the Katz people. So that when opportunity came to either sell or move, a lot of them sold, and some just gave it up. They just said, we can 't, you know, I'm not going to go through that. So the whole character of the shoe industry changed from being a friendly, but still competitive business, all of a sudden it just kind of was falling apart. Almost a house of dominoes, you know. But it was a good industry, because I think everybody in the industry tried to improve the way we made shoes, they tried to improve the jobs of the people, there was a lot of management training. I was president of the Associated Shoe Executives of Maine for a couple of terms in the sixties. And then in the seventies, I was president of the Boston Shoe Club, which was made up of shoe manufacturers and sales people in this case. But again, it was a fraternity that developed over many, many years, and it was all in helping each other, and that was very true. So people did try, and there was several young people, like me at the time, some that worked for me that was on the way to improving themselves, to make themselves more valuable to their industry."
"AL:","Were there any people who did particular jobs, that you observed , that really stood out in their profession? I know sometimes hand sewers - ."
"NO:","Well, hand sewers, there were a lot, and I knew a lot. In fact, we had a hand sewing contractor here in Lewiston, who we had him work for us for three or four years, at least. As long as we had those shoes in our line. Then if they dropped , well , then they dropped out. And I still , some of the hand sewers that did the work for him, and know me, and I still see them today. I think the other jobs, there were a lot of jobs that were particularly important, but pattern making, I felt, designing of footwear, of products, being what ever they were, I think, always seems quite important to me. And I worked very closely with , we had a pattern company in Brockton, see, my office, I had offices in Richmond, and in Brockton, and during my stay, I did a lot of traveling with the company, which was tough sometimes on my family life because I was away from Tuesday to Friday, or Monday to Thursday or whatever. So I was close with Dunbar Pattern , and we had one man there who was just assigned to our account and took care of our needs, so it made it easy. We did not have an in-house pattern maker I guess as worked with him as close as I could . But during that time, I bought leather, I learned my way around the leather industry, which was why, in 1980, it was a natural for me, in '82, to, because I found, I really couldn't find anything I liked here in Maine, and I was offered really two jobs at one point. One of them up in New York state someplace, it was from a fishing equipment company, and then another shoe job in Florida. So I had to think about that, and I had to talk about it with my wife. And I just decided at some point that I'm not going to do that, I'm not going to move. Now I'm going to take a job around here someplace, or where I can travel, like Brockton before. But we're not going to just pick up all our three kids and , you know, start all over someplace. So, because I had seen some, we had some of our own men in Brockton, sales people, move from , let's say from the midwest to Brockton , and you know, wives become very unhappy being away from home, being away from mom or whatever. All kinds of different things developed , and I remember one of my sales managers telling me, he says, you know, when I used to come here, when I lived in Kansas City and I came here, he says, you know, I was the golden boy, everybody wanted to go out to dinner with me, we'd stop and have a drink, and it was all fine . All of a sudden, I move here with my family , we don't talk to anybody anymore hardly. So that was on my mind too. I didn't want to go through that. So, that's when I decided to, because I went through a few headhunters, and I talked to one of them in Portland, who studied my resume and background, and he says, you 're not going to find anything like that here, you're just not going to find it here in Maine. And he says, if you tell me that you don't want to accept anything outside, you 're just not going to do it. He says, you have to change what it is you 're looking for. So I had a chance, the same person, as a matter of fact, for whom I had done the contract hand sewing with, came to me one day, and he had a piece of leather and he said, would you know where we could get this. Well, I looked at it, I said well, I don't know, but I don't have anything to do right now, so, I'm going to Boston next week and l'lllet you know, let me look. Well it just so happens, I went to a jobber and there was exactly what the guy wanted , exactly. So I brought back, but while I was visiting, this was a company called , Lewis R. Silverman, who were jobbers, I saw that they had a lot of leather. I would look at pieces of leather, I'd say, Falcon Shoe is using this, and Eastland Shoe is using this leather. So I brought back pieces of leather. First I got the leather for the guy who wanted to make dog collars and leashes for, really for military, for attack dogs, and muzzles and that kind of stuff. So once I got that settled then I, so I went to these other companies and I said , you know, I'm thinking of going into the leather business, and here's some leather that I found . Is this of any interest. So I sold a few lots of these leathers that were available, with a pretty decent profit. So all of a sudden, this became fairly attractive to me. I remember that we made two big hits. One of them was with Falcon, when I presented them with a small piece of leather, again, that they were using, there was thirty-five thousand feet of this leather. That's a lot of leather. Well, I thought maybe they would take, five thousand feet would have been a nice order. So Ted Johanson, who was the owner of the company said , after he had seen a sample and a bundle and was satisfied with what he felt the quality was good, he says, how much of th is have you got. I said, I've got thirty-five thousand feet. I'll take it. My head reeled back. That was really the beginning, the beginning of a lot of years in that business. And then there was a company out on 495 who was in the luggage business and that kind of stuff, and they made these backpacks with leather bottoms on them. Well, I went in to this guys, because I knew him, the guy had been in the leather business, in the shoe business, in (unintelligible), and I knew him , a guy by the a name of Jacobs. Again, I showed him some swatches of leather, because they were not too particular about what they put on the bottom, as long as you had enough , see. So there was one particular lot, again, that was about thirty thousand feet or so, too. It was more what we call crust, but it was very satisfactory to him and he said okay, I'll take it. I said, you 'll take what. He said, I'll take this. I says, I call him Jack, Jack, I says, there's thirty thousand feet. Yup, it's all right. Well, that was another big one. It just rolled like that. So then I started, besides the leather, which I picked up a couple of lines from, geeze, I forgot the name, Georgetown, Mass. making the foot beds that go inside the shoes. That little orange cradle in the heel, or stuff like that. Well, I developed that business big time, and that became, from a commission standpoint, was very attractive, lucrative for me. It refinanced the leather business for me, because I needed financing, and that was really, that did quite well. A year after I started, and now I needed help. I needed help, I needed to make a decision. Am I going to stay alone and stay small, or am I going to develop this thing. So my son, who was then married and living in Kansas City, and his wife was about to have a child, and my wife said, her mother was living here in Lewiston and was not well, so my wife said gee, how about if I go to help her out. So I said, okay. But I wrote a letter to my son and had her hand carry it, and essentially in that letter I wrote him that, if you guys want to come back to Lewiston , here's a job to come back to. If not, that's okay, I'll just decide on that. So obviously they came back. So he and I worked very close for several years, and we worked we ll together, by and large. That was the history of, and we worked , we developed other lines. We had other lines, good lines like Roger's Corporation of Connecticut that we were agents for. We had other products that we sold , and people were looking to us. But we couldn 't take everything, you know, because I still wanted to do the leather business, and that was first with us. But then again , we get back, now we 've gone full circle, and now the shoe companies are beginning to go, or close or what have you. We could see our demand declining too. So I stayed with it as long as I could . As a matter of fact, I stayed with it without salary for a couple of years, just to help (unintelligible) . So, I retired from there, I was seventy-four, so it was time for me to not do anything and enjoy life. Although I did enjoy life right there, I did. But the shoe industry and the leather industry were very good to me. We had good associations with clients, with people that we bought leather from , like Prime Tanning, and another tannery up in Hartland, and out west. I visited tanneries in Milwaukee, and Redwood, Minnesota. So we had good rapport and trust with each other. I think I was well regarded in the industry, and developed as, that was my reputation."
"AL:","Can I ask you a little more detail about how you learned leather? What is it you looked for, and how did you -?"
"NO:","Well, I guess you 'd have to say I started learning leather when I first started at Lombard and Watson, because part of what I did there was, first of all , receiving the leather as it came in from the tanneries. And then there was sorting, because they made, I called them old ladies' jumping shoes, but in those days, the black dressy shoes that the nuns would wear, or older ladies, there was a lot of that, that was a big business. They were not the only ones making those shoes. But most of them were kid skin. You would get a big box of kid skin , well, you had to sort it, because the poorer grades would go into one certain shoe. And then you 'd have to know the feel, the weight, the grain of the leather and so on and so forth . Again, build a knowledge of what was expected from that leather. So then, after I went to work for the Charles Eaton Company, one of the, in fact the leather buyer was one of the fellows who interviewed me for the job. As a result, I th ink within a year that I was there, I was working very closely with him , because he was approaching retirement age, and eventually he did retire . So all of a sudden I'm the leather buyer. I was foreman of the cutting room when I started there. And of course, I knew leather, from having cut leather. So I knew what it was at Bel Moe for those types of shoes. And once, at Etonic, I had Eaton, I had maybe a little broader knowledge of it, because they made a lot of different shoes. Lot's of different things. So I developed a knowledge there of the different, and the tanneries, you know, who the best tanners were, who gave you consistent quality. The one problem at Eaton that I had was, because they made, they couldn 't buy in large, large quantities, so we had to try to get smaller quantities, because this is the way our company was. But then, as I visited tanneries and I saw how leather was made and the working conditions really that those people in tanneries endured, it made the shoe industry look pretty good to me, because the leather industry is dirty, and it's smelly, and it's wet, and it's dusty. Plus the environmental, that they had to do something with their off (unintelligible) , their sewerage, and that's really what made it very difficult for that industry. But I saw all that happen, and it was quite a thing. But they made good leather, even in spite of all these conditions, they had good people. One of the very early ones that I saw go down, that I was chagrined for it, was a company called Garlic Tanning Company, in Taunton, Mass. , and I had visited with them, I knew the salesmen quite well, and the sales manager. I had an open door in there. And we used some of their leather in our dress shoes we had. All of a sudden , they just closed, they just, whatever, I'm not sure. I think it's what the government expected them to do, and they couldn 't. They just couldn't spend a half a million dollars, or a million , who knows, to do what was demanded of them ."
"AL:","Environmentally?"
"NO:","Environmentally, yeah, that was a big problem, because they weren 't big enough to do that. But as other companies, I went out west there, to Redwing , Minnesota, nice, very nice tannery making . Heavier leathers for work shoes and boots. Very nice stuff. Fisher and Vogel was another one out there that I visited . Trustell Tanning Company, that was the biggest leather manufacturer in the world at that time, at one point, I think for the same reason , closed their doors. Rather than spend, in their case might have been a few million dollars for all I know, rather than spend that kind of money in an industry that looked kind of questionable, you know, you could see the handwriting on the wall as to what was developing . They just didn't want to risk it. Again, that was privately owned, so no stock holders to worry about. So they closed . But those that stayed , and Prime Tanning was one of them, in South Berwick, they stayed on I guess as long as they could, and then opened the tannery in China, which makes sense. That's where the shoes are being made. So that's really where I got, but getting back, we 've gone full circle. I got a good background of sorting and manufacturing of leather. I spent several days working with some pretty good people in that field ."
"AL:","Is there anything that I haven't asked you about your experiences in the shoe industry, that you feel are important to add, before we end?"
"NO:","As I said, no, I think you've asked me all the right questions, and I would just repeat, I just never, never thought, in my wildest dreams, that all of the industry would leave, or would go wherever they went, except for the few that are here, and they're very specialized at what they do. But even in the country as a whole, there's very few shoes being made here in this country now. And Florsheim Shoe Company, for instance, that had several factories in the Chicago area, and I visited with them. They shared with me, there were not secrets in this business, you know. Then they just couldn 't handle it any more either. So they started buying their shoes, and I know they had shoes come in from Italy and Yugoslavia at the time, and they were very critical of the types of shoes they bought, and I'm sure they tried as much as they could to maintain the quality. But price wise, it was difficult to compete. The labor was high, and unions were after them, things like that. In our factory in Richmond, Maine, and I had a factory in Lewiston, and eventually, under Colgate, I bought the Bon-Ann Shoe Company, in Auburn , because we needed a place to make our tennis shoes. And then I also made running shoes there. But we had no union . When I worked at Lewiston as a cutter, I belonged to the union and eventually became a union steward , so I knew my way around that business. One of the thoughts that I always had, I knew how people wanted to be treated , and if I ever had a, my voice, there would not be a union in a factory that I work, and there wasn 't either. Although there were two union campaigns. When election time came around , they didn't make it. So we stayed non union. So that's really the crux of my experience. I enjoyed it. I really did enjoy it. The people in Richmond were good shoe makers, and hard workers. And then I enjoyed the leather business too, which was an altogether different approach."
"AL:","Well great, thank you so much."
"NO:","You're welcome."
