"(Note:","Where Rachel is translating and answering for her father in English, we are using her father’s initials, “CB”, throughout the transcript. When she is answering or commenting herself, we are using her initials, “RD”. The transcript is a reflection of the conversation in English, as it was translated, for clarity of reading. This might be an interesting project to have someone French-speaking, add the French conversation in a revised version of the transcript.) Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Mill Workers Oral History Project. The date is December 2nd, the year 2005, we're at the home of Cyrille and Emma Baillargeon, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. Today, Rachel Desgrosseilliers, the daughter, will be helping to translate from English to French and French to English. Rachel, could you first start by asking your dad where and when he was born? Cyrille Baillargeon: Nineteen eighteen, July 22, 1918."
"AL:","And did he grow up there?"
"CB:","He came at thirteen years."
"AL:","And did he move to Lewiston at that time?"
"CB:","Yes."
"AL:","And what was the reason for moving from Canada, his parents leaving?"
"CB:","He says because his father came down first with his brother and sister, because there was no work in Canada so they came here to work, and when they saw there was work here they sold everything in Canada and moved everybody down here. They lived in Labosse Canada, which is a section that, if you say Labosse people know exactly where that is, so he wanted to say that."
"AL:","And was it the mills that gave the work to his parents, to bring them here?"
"CB:","His father came to work in the woods as a logger, a lumberjack, and he went to work with them as a lumberjack also when he first came. 1"
"AL:","So at age thirteenish."
"RD:","Yes."
"AL:","Already working in the woods."
"RD:","As a lumberjack, yeah."
"AL:","And how long did he do that?"
"CB:","Two, three years."
"AL:","And is that when you entered the mill?"
"CB:","He went to Hill for a couple of months, and then he moved over to Bates and stayed there for thirty eight years, yeah, thirty seven years he stayed at Bates."
"AL:","So he entered the mill at about sixteen years old?"
"CB:","Had to be sixteen, yeah, sixteen."
"AL:","Now I'd like to switch to your mom and get her background, and start with the same sorts of questions."
"RD:","She can answer her own."
"AL:","Okay, could you tell me where and when you were born? Emma Baillargeon: I was born in Lewiston, Maine, and I stayed in Lewiston until the and of five, at five we moved in Auburn, Middlefield's Corner, and at age of sixteen when I was about to graduate from the eighth grade, seeing I was sixteen my father wanted me to go to work so they got a job for me. I worked in one shoe shop doing some staining of the side of the shoes, and from there then we moved over to Lewiston, and from there that's where I got a job at Bates Mill as the (unintelligible word) inspector."
"AL:","So at the time you were growing up, the shoe shops were still very big in Auburn especially. 2"
"EB:","Oh, yes, yes. I don't remember what shop it was, but it was on Court Street. That was a long time ago."
"AL:","Did your parents work in the shoe industry as well?"
"EB:","My mother worked at the Flap, Flap Shoe, after we moved in Lewiston. And my father, he was, I don't know, worked in the (name) Company, whatever that is, I don't know."
"RD:","Feldspar Company?"
"EB:","Is that what that, I don't know. Then I think he landed in a shoe shop, too."
"AL:","And how many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"EB:","I had three sisters and four brothers. I got only one brother living, and two sisters are still living."
"AL:","Have they all stayed in the Lewiston area?"
"EB:","No, one of my brothers moved in Monmouth, he was (unintelligible word) and he moved in Monmouth."
"AL:","And can you ask your dad how many brothers and sisters he had?"
"CB:","They were twelve, eight, there were eight girls and four brothers, and four boys, including him, so there were twelve, twelve children. He's the only boy left, and there's only three sisters."
"AL:","My question is how did you make ends meet, how did the family do that with all those children?"
"CB:","They worked on the, well when they were little they worked on the farms, and then when they got here, well they, that's why they started working young so that they would help with the family, they all started getting checks and stuff, so."
"RD:","(Continues on her own) But it was a tough, they did with a, I remember my grandparents, and when we were little they did with little, you know, they didn't spend a lot on frivolous things, it was, so."
"AL:","Now, in Lewiston, did they have a garden, a vegetable garden? 3"
"CB:","No, no, they didn't have any."
"AL:","And so I want to go back to your dad, and he started in the mill at age sixteen, and ask him broadly what it was like when he started, and then talk about how it changed over time in terms of the mill itself, and his job responsibilities?"
"CB:","He was a bobbin fixer, then he went to weaving, and he wove for thirty-seven years. He worked on the cotton. It was tough. He was on the large looms. It was hard because they had to work fast and fast all the time, because if something broke, threads broke or something, it stopped their looms and they couldn't earn, they just were idle."
"AL:","So did that make the loom fixers very valuable to them, to have a good working relationship?"
"CB:","If it took too, if it was too long that they couldn't get a loom fixer to go then they would get, they would start paying them again, but you know, it had to be a long, long period. They were paid just the same, after, if it took too long. He says the bosses, it was hard because the bosses were always on their backs because sometimes there were some imperfections in the cotton. He says because, he says, well, it was our fault because, he says, because if it broke then when we started back up, you know, there were imperfections and stuff, so it was their fault. It really wasn't their fault in one sense, but you know. He says that it was very loud, and he says he put the plugs, but I asked him, I says, when did you start, he says, oh, he says, it was only towards the end. He says all the way at the beginning, you know, there wasn't any. It was really, really hot so that was another thing that was hard to work with."
"EB:","There was something about a loom girl, too, that was, that bothered them when she checked in, or something like that."
"RD:","Oh, yeah, that's something different, Ma."
"CB:","The room girl would go around and she would help them, try and translate, I think what he means, une quete is a bundle with, bundle up type thing, and the room girl is the one that would come in would have to take that all apart to get that working again. So I guess it sounds like the loom fixer and the loom girl, they had to depend on to make their looms keep going. My Aunt 4 Emma was the one, you're going to interview her, but she was a loom girl so she'll be able to talk to you about what that was all about."
"AL:","What was the air like in the room?"
"CB:","He says that it was, sometimes it was hard to breathe, there was so much, you know, between the air and the humidity, and there was lint all over the place."
"RD:","And that's where I remember my dad coming home, and I always wondered why he had lint in his eyes, his nose, his mouth, even his belly button. You know, we'd laugh at him when he'd come home, you know, because he looked like a, almost like a snowman filled with lint and stuff, and he had to clean his clothes all the time. But I went to visit him when he retired, just before he retired, and I had all, came out of there with all the admiration and in tears because, to think that he worked thirty eight years like that for us, the children, was like amazing. Because that noise was, we couldn't, we had to yell at each other, and we were right in front of each other. And the lint was all over the place, and it was so hot we were dripping when we were in there, you know."
"AL:","I've heard that when they would go around and sort of clean up the lint they would use a blower, which actually put a lot of it in the air. I'm wondering if he -"
"RD:","Remembers that?"
"CB:","He says it would go all over the place."
"AL:","Instead of bringing it right in out of the air."
"RD:","Instead of bringing, instead of sucking it in it would blow, it would just dissipate it, you know?"
"CB:","They'd blow it with a big hose."
"AL:","I would like to ask him if he became, he and your mom, became social with the people they worked with, or was it separate?"
"CB:","They would go smoke, they'd get together and take their breaks together. They'd make friends, the weavers that worked close together, and they'd take their breaks together and everything but, they would have, they had a half hour they'd take their lunch, and then they had to go in the little smoke shacks that we have and – yeah, he doesn't smoke any more. But they would go in the 5 smoke shacks and take a smoke before, they would stop their looms and then they would go back to their looms."
"RD:","I don't remember that you guys really chummed around with the mill workers. You met in a lot of social places, but it's not like you made arrangements to go out to dinner together or things like that."
"AL:","Right, that's sort of the thing I was asking, outside of work, who was their social circle?"
"RD:","It was mostly family, right? Family."
"EB:","You're too tired to be able to go anywheres."
"RD:","Yeah, that's right, okay, that's a good point. That's right, he came home exhausted so, you know, so it was only on the weekends. And most of the social activities that I remember us being was Sundays we'd go at my grandma, at his mom and dad's house and the whole family would get together. That was their social life. And then the social life at their church, they participated as volunteers, they participated in helping in the fairs and all this stuff that was going on there. Oh, and also part of their social was they did a lot of volunteering for a long time. They belonged Les Marchands de Banard at d'Youville now but it used to be Marcotte Home, the nursing home across from St. Mary's Hospital, and they belonged there and for years and years and years they helped, volunteered to help the elderly people there. So that was more their social than what we know today of, let's go out to dinner. And that's where they would meet their, get to meet the people they worked with, because that was the thing to do, that's how they did it those days."
"AL:","Were there activities in the mills that bonded people together in terms of sports or things like that?"
"RD:","Not him. There were sports teams and stuff, but he didn't participate in that."
"AL:","I'd be interested to know if he has specific memories that have stuck out in his mind from his times in the mill, anecdotes or work experiences?"
"RD:","Well, I was asking him this morning about did he go through any strikes type thing, and that had, that seemed to say -"
"AL:","Let's ask him. 6"
"CB:","They didn't want to pay them so they went on strike, so they all got together and they left, they went out of the mill. The unions worked hard, he said, to get us back to work. It was over a month. They didn't have a pay, so they went to get some food - (Interrupted by knock on the door.)"
"AL:","And so we were saying?"
"RD:","You said that you went to go get food during the strike?"
"EB:","I know we had a little help."
"RD:","During the strike, okay."
"CB:","He says they gained, he doesn't remember how much but it was worth going back for, you know, for them in those days."
"EB:","When I stopped working I was making only seventeen fifty."
"CB:","He says that after the strike they had all gotten together, he thinks it was one or two months that it lasted, and then they all went back, and he thinks he was making seventeen a week, but Mom -"
"EB:","When I stopped working when Richard was born I was -"
"RD:","And Richard was born in 1943?"
"EB:","Yeah, I had seventeen dollars and fifty cents about."
"RD:","A week? So it sounds about right."
"EB:","Maybe a little bit more him because he, you were born when they had that strike."
"RD:","I was born when the strike came? I was born in 1945. That's still not a lot of money, seventeen dollars a week."
"EB:","Yeah, but in those times. 7"
"RD:","Yeah, we were talking about that yesterday."
"AL:","Was your dad ever involved in the union affairs, other than just being a member?"
"RD:","No, no, he was just a member."
"AL:","Are there other things that he recalls?"
"CB:","Okay, he said they had good bosses and bad bosses, and he says one was really horrible. He'd get really mad at them, you know, when there were imperfections or something, even though it was the looms that was doing it and stuff, and he says he was rough with them."
"AL:","Physically or verbally?"
"CB:","No, he said push but he meant push in the sense of that he would, he'd be on their backs to do, you know, to keep doing more and more and more and more, so, and he says that was hard, so (unintelligible word), because the other bosses understood and would tell them to just keep going."
"AL:","Did that boss, the mean one, last for a long time?"
"CB:","He doesn't remember how long he lasted, but he says quite a while."
"AL:","And I'd be interested to know what shift your dad worked on, and how it related to your mom's schedule."
"CB:","Thirty-seven years on first shift, which was day shift, so, that was a good shift to be on for him and the children."
"AL:","And I want to ask your mom what shift she worked on when she was there."
"EB:","I was on the first shift in the cloth room, and then the boss was Mr. Hemond, and then when he left there was Don Morin, and his sister was a loom girl, (name)."
"RD:","How long did you work at the mill?"
"EB:","About nine years. 8"
"RD:","Why did you stop working?"
"EB:","Because they started a second shift and they asked me to go on the second shift, but I (unintelligible phrase) I'll go, if I don't like it I'll come back on the day shift. So the, (unintelligible phrase), and Hemond put me out, sent me home. And then they had to call me back because they found out that the mistake was in the weave room, the number on the thing there. So I went back. And then, that's where I went on the second shift. And then when I was pregnant for Dick, I had to go see the doctor. It was too much for me, so the doctor says, he says, either you stop working or go back to your day, or you could stay home. And when I went on the day I had lost all my, because of that they had me, made me lose all my seniority, and I saw that, so I stayed home. I never went back to work."
"AL:","And how many children did you two have?"
"EB:","We had six. We lost the first one. I was working when we had the first one, and then when I was pregnant for the second one, that's where I stopped working."
"AL:","That's when the doctors -"
"EB:","He told me, you stay home or go back to first shift, because it was too nerve wracking at night."
"RD:","Well, I get a kick out of your saying that I stopped working, because I don't think you stopped working, you started taking care of children, didn't you, here?"
"EB:","Not right away because I had Cecil and Anita."
"RD:","Before you started taking care of children?"
"EB:","Yeah, I started taking children when we moved here in 1950."
"RD:","Well, that's pretty early. Because I remember that we never were just us children here, you know, there was always a, in the morning there was always a load of two or three kids being dropped off, and two, three kids picked up."
"EB:","I'm not sure, I think he went into two strikes, because I think when we were living here there was something that, where I had taken a lot of children in. 9"
"RD:","Yeah, to cover, I remember that."
"AL:","During the strike?"
"RD:","I remember something about, I don't remember when in my childhood, but I remember how we were struggling."
"EB:","I babysat at least fifty children. Today they see me, they recognize me, they come and see me, some of them come and see me, but I don't, I look in the door, I don't know who you are. And tell who he is and I'm surprised."
"RD:","Coming to see them with their children now."
"EB:","There's one that, Julie Marcotte now, she still calls us matante en oncle, but she's still, she was one of the first ones."
"AL:","Can you talk about your time at the mill, and in the cloth room, what it was like?"
"EB:","Well, there's not much to say. We'd get there and take our place and do our work."
"AL:","What was your work like?"
"EB:","Well, we had to turn the, there was big cloths there, bundles there, and they put them on the table and then when they have to turn the pages and if we see some mistakes we'd have to have some scissors and, a hook and a comb, to put, fix the place. And there was something wrong, we'd have to call the loom girl to come and fix it. We'd have to wait for her to come and fix it. And then I was getting, we had social things, we had picnics, we went on picnics with the cloth room several times. I got some pictures, they must be in the attic."
"RD:","You have pictures of that?"
"EB:","Must be in the attic. Once we were in a truck, we were pulling up some lobsters."
"AL:","Did the company help pay for the picnics, or was it all done by the employees?"
"EB:","It was the company. If I remember right, it was the company. 10"
"RD:","So every time you went to picnics with the people you worked with, the company paid for it?"
"EB:","I think so, I can remember -"
"RD:","Because somebody brought a picture all rolled up, a long picture, in 1937, the Hill Mill picnic at Taylor Pond."
"EB:","That was me, that was mine, you had to fix it up, eh? Because it was -"
"RD:","Yeah, that's the lady that brought it to you at the senior citizen there."
"EB:","No, I gave you one."
"RD:","Well, we looked at it and she said 1937? She says, wow, she says, that's, she says I was working there. So it's a long, long picture and there's hundreds and hundreds of people, and we couldn't find her, then I found her, she was twenty years old and she's right on the picture."
"EB:","I gave you that, I gave you that because you said it's, it was ripping because it was so old and folded up, and you said that you could put it together, fix it up."
"RD:","Yeah, we did."
"EB:","I gave you, I gave you one of those. I have the pictures also of the cloth room, all the cloth room, taking pictures of the cloth room and we had to have outfits -"
"RD:","We need to dig those out so we can make copies."
"EB:","They're in the attic."
"AL:","So you had certain outfits you had to wear to work? What were they, can you describe them, do you recall?"
"EB:","It was just like a, I want to say (unintelligible word), it's (unintelligible word), it has like a dress or a costume like, I remember the white, or yellow, not yellow, they were white, I think (unintelligible phrase) blue. We had to wear those to work, so we were all the same color."
"AL:","Was it, can you, was it like a smock? 11"
"EB:","Yeah, yeah."
"AL:","Like a smock."
"RD:","Yeah, on the picture it looks like it's a one-piece smock type thing that they wore."
"EB:","We did that on when you went to work and you take it off when you got home."
"AL:","So when you worked there, were the women more likely to be in certain job positions and men in others, or were you all mixed?"
"EB:","We were only women, in the inspection. The men were in the back bringing the cloths in and -"
"AL:","Was there a sense that the women were paid equally to the men?"
"EB:","That I couldn't tell."
"RD:","So you guys didn't, you didn't find that, you didn't get upset that the men were getting paid more or less than you or whatever. Did the men, I guess what she's asking is did the men earn more than you."
"EB:","That I don't know."
"RD:","You don't know, okay."
"AL:","And how were you treated at the mill?"
"EB:","Okay, got along fine with everybody. There was long tables, we were so many per table."
"AL:","Your husband has talked a little bit about the conditions where he worked in the mill, in terms of it being hot and dusty, and did you have that same atmosphere?"
"EB:","No, no, no because it was not the same thing, it was in a cool room, you know. Maybe when we took the, if there was a bump in the cotton there, we'd take that off and we would put it, throw it on the floor or something like that. 12"
"AL:","And you didn't have the noise either?"
"EB:","No, no."
"RD:","So you were kind of more at the finishing end of the product, rather than the weaving."
"EB:","(Unintelligible phrase) for them, too. So when we were finished, we'd have to call them and the men would come over and take it from the women and have another one. Long time ago."
"AL:","Rachel, I want to ask you if there's things that you know about your parents' time working that you think would be valuable to ask them that I might not know about."
"RD:","Okay, when they first got in in the morning, they'd change into their overalls, and then they would put on their little apron in front of them. And they would wear those because if they didn't they would wear out all their overalls, and they couldn't afford to buy them often so they'd put those little aprons to protect them. So at night, they had lockers, and they would change back to their street clothes. So when it was time to leave, they all got in, they changed and they all got in line at the door, but they couldn't leave until the red light would go off, in the, just a light, and they couldn't leave until the red light went on because they could not get off the premises before three thirty, which is when they were going to end."
"EB:","The same thing with me. We went in line, we were in a bunch."
"RD:","Yeah, I think it was just a race who was going to get out of there first."
"RD:","He says when the red light went on, then it was who was going to get out first. I remember when I was a child, going down sometimes if we had appointments or something and we'd meet Dad, remember, at the bridge, at the head of the bridge, and we'd wait. And when we were little we'd hurry to try to see Dad first because, I mean, it was a sea of people coming out of there, you know. So I remember that."
"EB:","I got the pictures, when he come out of work and the kids are all there waiting for him."
"RD:","You do?"
"AL:","That's another one to dig for in the attic. 13"
"RD:","I guess I got to dig more, we got to dig a lot. That's okay, we'll do it later, Mom."
"CB:","He says his brother Henry, they wanted, went to work and they called them in to come in at midnight, and he said three o'clock he had had enough, he took off and went home."
"EB:","He never went back."
"RD:","He never went back, he never worked there again."
"CB:","He says, it was much too hard, I'm not staying here, and he didn't, you know, and he lasted thirty-eight years. Then he went back, Henry went back to work lumber jacking. I guess he liked the air better. I asked him, he seems to, every time we see Fred Lebel, he lights up and he seems to be real happy to see him, so I asked him how come you're all, you know, he says, well he was overseer. And I says, well what did the overseer do? He says, well he's the one who saw over everything and he would hire people and stuff, and he says he's a real nice man. He says when people were looking for work and they really needed work, they'd come in in the morning and try to find work and they'd have to go see Mr. Lebel, and he's the one that would hire them. He says sometimes it was really hard to get work, because there was no positions open. So people would come and there was no place to put them."
"AL:","Can you ask him was there a sort of system where if you knew somebody, to help you get in the door?"
"CB:","He says if you, okay, he says it usually helped to know somebody in the mills, because they wouldn't hire just anybody, so I guess it was kind of like a reference or something."
"AL:","And I'd like to ask him about the ethnic groups that were in the mill, and if he worked with Irish and Greek, or were they working in different places in the mill, or were they all mixed?"
"CB:","There were a lot more, you know, but there were a lot more Canadians. It was all mixed up, they worked together. 14"
"AL:","Were there rivalries? Or how do you ask that?"
"CB:","They just worked all together, there was no, you know, they didn't look at that, he says, so."
"RD:","I'm trying to think -"
"CB:","When they retire, when he retired after thirty-eight years, he received a nice bedspread from them as a gift, going away gift."
"RD:","Which one, do you know? The George Washington?"
"EB:","The beige one there. I don't know the name of it, they had them there when we went for the reunion."
"RD:","I don't remember which one it is, but that's what he received was, after thirty-eight years, a bedspread made there."
"AL:","And I'd like to ask both your mum and dad, they can give their separate responses, about what they saw, and your dad will have a longer perspective, about how they saw the mill change over the years in terms of quality, productivity, growth or reductions in the work force, and technology, how did technology change?"
"CB:","Well, he didn't see many of the changes because he was always on the exact same equipment and job."
"AL:","So the equipment did not change in those thirty-eight years?"
"CB:","No, no, thirty-eight years it just stayed, in his section. Number two weave room - End of Side A Side B"
"AL:","We are now on side B. You asked something about change in the mills?"
"CB:","He says the change that came about from when he first started towards, you know, was that in the unions they, if one got laid off, all the others got together and worked to get that worker back in. 15 I asked if they built any buildings or anything when he was there, but he says no, and I think that's true."
"AL:","What year did he retire?"
"RD:","When did you, we figured it out the other day, is it 1972?"
"EB:","I got that on a book somewheres. He was sixty-two."
"RD:","He was sixty-two, born in '18."
"AL:","So that's '81."
"RD:","Nineteen eighty-one? Yeah, that sounds more, that sounds right, yeah, '81. I remember what we did is, the day he retired it was a big thing because we were older then and we understood more what it meant that he worked there, and we were glad to see that he was getting out. Because we could tell that, as he was getting older, that it was harder and harder on him, so all the children with their wives and children, husbands, and grandchildren, we just all went to meet him at the gate, where we talked about when the buzzer went off, there, that they come out. So we have pictures of that, too, where the children were all there when Dad came out with his bedspread that he got for thirty eight years, and we were proud to take him home with us."
"EB:","He came out with his lunch box."
"RD:","Lunch box and everything, and so one child, one of us took his lunch box, somebody else took his, carried his bedspread for him, and we were all hurraying on that little bridge of the mill that was there, at the gatehouse where they came out. So, it was a big day when he retired."
"AL:","Did the mills change ownership during the time he was there?"
"RD:","Was he there when the employees bought it, or was that after him?"
"EB:","It had been after him."
"RD:","It was after him. I think it was, I think the changes all, yeah, '81, yeah. 16"
"AL:","Were later eighties and nineties."
"RD:","Yeah, it was more later where it did that."
"AL:","And you wanted to ask him about his pension."
"CB:","He got his pension."
"EB:","He was having $85.50, and they changed it to '$86 later on. They had made a mistake, so they put it up to $86.50."
"RD:","Yeah, he gets $86.50 a month for his work."
"EB:","He could have taken it different ways, do a different way of taking it. (Unintelligible phrase) figured to take it where he got that much by the month, and when he passes away, I get half of it. And we've earned quite a bit since that time."
"RD:","Oh, that's right, I remember there were two ways that they could do it. They could, one of them was they could take a lump sum right there, or -"
"EB:","All, all of it."
"RD:","Or all of it."
"EB:","Which would have been three thousand something, that's all."
"RD:","Or take so much a month, $86.50 a month, and they decided to take the $86.50 a month. And what did you say, that if Dad dies you get half of that? You keep getting half of that? So you made out better than taking the lump sum, or the three, yeah. But when you stop and think, $86.50 for a pension to live on is not -"
"AL:","Not in today's terms."
"RD:","No, so."
"AL:","And I wanted to be sure and ask you if you saw any changes in the work that you did during those nine years in the cloth room? 17"
"EB:","No, there was no changes at all during that time. That's in the olden days."
"RD:","It was the olden days, yeah."
"AL:","The other question I want to ask, I know that the work was very hard, I wondered if there was any time where employees sort of joked around or, you know, played pranks or just sort of added a little humor to the work."
"CB:","He says, well, we didn't have much time to do any of that. He says, yeah, he says there were some jokesters that would play tricks on us, but he doesn't remember specifics about it."
"AL:","And your mom?"
"EB:","No, we were so busy that we didn't have time to do any joking."
"AL:","I think that's all the questions I have. I'll certainly come back, you know, if we think of more."
"AL:","Anything that sticks out in his memory that I haven't asked him about?"
"RD:","I asked him if he remembers what looms he was working on. He doesn't, he can't remember the name right now."
"AL:","Well, thank you both very much for your time, I appreciate, merci."
