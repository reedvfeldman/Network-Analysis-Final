"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) March 14, 2006 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Mill Workers Oral History project. The date is March 14th, the year 2006. This is Andrea L’Hommedieu, and today I’m interviewing Lilliane Morin at her home on Lisbon Road in Lisbon, Maine. Could I start just by asking you to say your full name, including your maiden name? Lilliane Morin: My name is Lilliane Adelia Morin, Lilliane Bernier."
"AL:","And what’s your date of birth?"
"LM:","December 22nd, 1934."
"AL:","And did you grow up in the Lewiston area?"
"LM:","Yes, I been in Lewiston all my life until forty-five years ago we move over here, it’s going to be forty six now."
"AL:","And what was growing up in Lewiston like in the ‘40s and ‘50s?"
"LM:","Well, I think it’s a lot better than what’s going on today. Yeah, the life was simpler, you know, we didn’t have everything. We were, they were poor, they worked, and my mother remarried and they worked in the mill, also, both of them worked in a textile mill, the Hill Mill. And so we were not financially, you know, they were not financially, so but we made it all right, though. But I, before that, before she got remarried I stayed at the orphanage, St. Joseph, there? We call it Marcotte Home. I stayed there until I was almost thirteen, I was twelve years old when I left the orphanage, because they got married and, but they took us out, you know."
"AL:","So it was a matter of being able to afford to feed you?"
"LM:","Yeah, that’s right, that’s right."
"AL:","And how many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"LM:","I have one brother and one sister, and I’m the oldest one. And my, then my stepfather had two kids, a boy and a girl also. But they stayed just a little bit with us, and then after that they were taken care of by their mother, you know, so they lived there."
"AL:","Was the orphanage run by the nuns at that time?"
"LM:","Oh yes, yes, and sisters, I’m French, you know, so I don’t say my words correctly in English, Sister St. (name). Well, I cried when I heard she was going away. She had a stroke apparently, and I went to see her and I cried, I cried. And she remembered my name, Lilliane Bernier, you know, she didn’t forget me at all. I was so surprised, you know, and I loved her, she was like a mother to us over there."
"AL:","So they treated you well. 1"
"LM:","Oh yes, I mean, you know, it’s not home, it’s not everything you want as far as the food. Oh, some of the food, though, wasn’t great, you know. But it’s not the same thing as living at home. Some of the kids were going home on weekends, and I was there all the time because I was a State help, you know, had help from the State. So, and, so that’s the way it worked. But yet, I think, God, today, realizing what we went through, what the, you know, the way things were, that I was lucky to have a place like that to stay. And I wish there were something like that going on today, you know, for the kids that don’t have homes or anything like that, you know. It was strict, but it was, it was okay, you know, I was not punished too much. Except one time, I said some bad words and they took soap and a toothbrush, washed my tongue. And I got sick, too. Never forget that, (unintelligible phrase). But in all, it was a good place to be, you know, we were lucky."
"AL:","And so your mom and stepdad both worked in the Hill Mill?"
"LM:","Yes, they both worked in the Hill Mill."
"AL:","What did they do there?"
"LM:","My mother was in the spinning room, I know she worked in the spinning. And him, I don’t remember too much what he was doing. I heard about card room, I think, before. I never paid attention what he was doing, you know. But the Sirois family worked in the mill, all of them, I think, most of them all did work over there, you know, they were living in the Hill Blocks at the time, some of them were there. But us, we were 313 Lisbon Street. So, yeah, that’s, that was quite a thing, to think back, you know. We had some good memories, some bad memories, you know, the past, you know. But in all that time, I always teach my, I always tell my kids or my nieces and nephew, if they complain about their life, what they have today, well, I say, now your age, you’re the one who makes your life. It’s true, it’s not, you can’t blame the parents what they did wrong or right, you know. Especially what they did wrong, you don’t go by that. You have to make your own living, you know, you have to make your own life. And whatever you do, it’s up to you. That’s what I feel, you know, I feel like that, you know. That’s it on that part."
"AL:","And you lived on Lisbon Street, and so you were close to the downtown shopping area."
"LM:","Oh, yes."
"AL:","Tell me about that (unintelligible word)."
"LM:","Oh, that was the most beautiful place we had downtown. We used to walk, when I met my husband, also he was across the street and he move in the same building, and when I met him we used to walk and hold hands. There was, at that time it was the High Park, it was not called Kennedy, it was Parc en Haute, you know, en haute, you know, it’s High Park. I guess that’s how you say it in English. And we used to have concert over there. The lifestyle of living was altogether different from what it is today, and we used to, the stores, oh. Ward Brothers, Francis Store, Bell Shop, I mean, you know, you walked, just looking in the windows, you know, because we didn’t have a car or anything and we were just dating a little bit, you know, and we used to walk. And I remember there was a vaudeville in Auburn I think, was it Lewiston? Auburn I think it was, or I don’t remember now because if was Lewiston or Auburn. My husband and I, we used to go see the vaudeville, you know, so that’s a long time ago. Ages. But the thing is, downtown Lewiston was a lot, there was beer joints, okay, but you never had anything what goes on today at that time. It was really nice, you know, you didn’t, didn’t bother you or anything, the drunks didn’t, there was not so many drunks. I think there were some, but you didn’t see them as much as you do today, you know. But it was a good living. We had, I think it was better, it was a lot better than what it is today, considering, because the Lisbon Street was beautiful at that time. Today, I don’t think so. Today you go 2 by, by car and you look and it’s disgusting, you know, to see, now you have all lawyers and everything like that on Lisbon Street and that’s all you see. You don’t see anything, stores like we used to have. We had grocery store, cleaner in, right, in the building with the cleaner, where we used to live. And across the road was Blanche, you used to have, and Frank, we used to stop over there, go over there. Met a guy, it was mostly a friend, not a real boyfriend, he was so cheap he couldn’t even buy a cone of ice cream. But we used to go to Frank to buy a cone of ice cream, you know. And there was Vaughn Clothing Store, and we used, and (name) was across from us, too, also, and I used to run clubs for their clothes, you know. My mother-in-law always took clubs over there and dressed me up, and then I started running clubs over there which was really nice, you know. So I enjoyed it, really, the Lisbon Street was a lot better. Even Knox Street and all that, so, I’m going to tell you something in a minute, can you turn it off for a minute?"
"AL:","And so, I wanted to ask you if, when you were staying with the nuns, if they put you in school. Did you go to school?"
"LM:","I had spinal meningitis when I was ten years old. I was going to St. Mary’s, and then I went in there. It’s confusing, my life, I lost my memory, well, then I was in there, so and I lost memory and they, I remember going, a big nun, she was a big nun, I don’t know her name, it was, I think it was the first grade. But I never did anything really to learn. I don’t remember learning. The only time I learned something that I remember was St. Mary’s School, we had sister St. Agathe, that’s how I lost this, here. I got this, this is fake, and I dropped it and I got the same thing again, the same thing (unintelligible phrase), that why everybody recognizes me. But as far as schooling in there, I don’t remember. Because there used to be some doctors come and check on me, to make me think, you know, I guess to memorize, you know, things. Because that’s what I did, I lost memory when I was younger, and partly there. And so anyhow, that’s what happened. But as far, the only time I remember school is at St. Mary’s, really. But the orphanage, I don’t remember school there."
"AL:","So, do you know what age you stopped going to school?"
"LM:","Yes, I went to, my mother took us out of St. Mary’s School to go to public school, because we didn’t know how to speak English. And so we went to Coburn School, and I had Miss Helen Harkin, was the best person, but I didn’t even speak English. And so I had a 100 in spelling, but didn’t know how to speak English at all. And then after that I went to Jordan School just for two months, and there was, where we were living there was a bridge on the porch, the porch floor, you know, there was a bridge to get out and I had moccasins on I guess, and I fell on my spine and, tip of the spine, so, and it was hurting so, and then after that they, my mother said, went to the hospital, I needed surgery, I had, it was all chipped, you know. So a Dr. Gauvreau operated on me. I was fifteen then. And then after that they said, my said, well since you’re so much in the hospital, missing school, you might as well go to work. I turned sixteen in December, see, that was between September and October I think I fell down, so I went work at the shoe shop. I was sixteen at that time. I was told to go."
"AL:","And they let you -?"
"LM:","Yeah, at that time you could go to school, go to work at that age, at sixteen, at that time. Gee, I happen to be seventy-one. Can’t you imagine all these things that happened? But that’s what we did anyhow, so I went to work."
"AL:","Was this full time?"
"LM:","Yes, full time, shoe shop. And when I got to be eighteen, I married my husband one month before I was seventeen, and I’m not sorry. It’s going to be, it’s fifty-four years of marriage, in November it’s going 3 to be fifty-five married, would you believe. Can’t believe I did that long, you know. But anyhow, so then I went to work in the mill when I was eighteen, Bates Mill, I started there in May."
"AL:","And what jobs did you do there, how did, what did you start out at?"
"LM:","Oh, my gosh, I did that, in the weave room, Number Five weave. That was, I had a lot of fun in that room. There was a, you worked, I was a battery hand, and we had magazine, you know, four of them, you know, you had yarn, the different colors, you know, to put on each (unintelligible word) the four. Then I worked on the C-4s, I work on the C-Ks, C-4s, and there was a little machine that came in later and I got to work on it, and I forgot how they call it, and they make plaids, material plaids to make skirt or, you know, outfits with that, jumpers and all that. And that’s what they did for that. That didn’t stay too long, though. But I mean, that was the best room. I work in Number One and Two, that was a total white material and the batteries are round on that one. That was a toughie I think, that’s too much, you know."
"AL:","So what is you liked about the weave room, was it the people or the job you -?"
"LM:","Oh, the people and the job I had, you know. I did love the job I had. And then I went to work, I stopped, I went down in the cloth room because the doctor said I couldn’t be upstairs, so, in the weave room."
"AL:","Because?"
"LM:","Because my womb was dropped, you know. So, because I couldn’t get pregnant, and I said, the doctor put his hand in the wrong place, then I found out I was pregnant, you know. And the womb was tipped, so that’s why I went to work in the cloth room, and I stayed there. That was nice, too. And then I went to work in the, I stopped, had my daughter, then I went back in, I worked in the fringe department. That was nice, too, that was a nice room to work. And I was there twelve years and a half in that room. Because they closed the room, that’s why the department, you know, so they didn’t make it, they still make more fringe, I hear, but they have another section of the mill where they do it. And I think they’re still making some, I hear, from another part of the mill. And then I went back, after they closed I went into the packing room, worked for Ralph Nelson. And then after that I went downstairs, I was still working for him, I worked downstairs on the sealer. You put the bedspread in the sealer, you know, in the plastic, you know, we (unintelligible phrase), so I did that, I did that, too. That was the last place I worked, and the last time I worked was in the cloth room. So, with (unintelligible phrase) packing. We’d put a bedspread on a belt and then it went up, and the girl upstairs packed it, you know. So that’s what we did."
"AL:","Now, the different areas of the mill you worked in probably had different working conditions? What sort of rooms, how was the air in the different rooms?"
"LM:","Well, in the weave room it was hot and it was humid a lot, you know, it was very humid, and it’s dusty a lot, it was very, very dusty. I’m surprised I don’t have any problems with that. And the fringe department, I used to be a creeler, we call it a creeler. We had big racks, you know, and you put the, it was rounded, the yarn that we put on, then we put it on the machine like that. (Telephone interruption.)"
"AL:","And you were talking about -"
"LM:","Oh, the humidity and the dust, and the grease also, you know, you have to be careful. And sometimes the shuttle pass[ed] right in front of you. One time I had the, I remember we had Mr. Michel, I’ll never forget him as long as I live. We got, I’ve got a piece of movies of that department. 4"
"AL:","You do?"
"LM:","Yes, yes, I’ve got that. I’ve got the, I was tiny, the kids didn’t even recognize me on that picture, I was small, with a ponytail and (unintelligible word), you know. (Unintelligible phrase) blouse and slim skirt. Well anyhow, I was wearing a flare, you know, we had petticoats in the fifties, you know, so I had a big petticoat and a flared skirt, too, and I got caught in the gears in the machine so, I was working with, she was a single woman and she was a weaver, and it was on the C-4, C-Ks, wait a minute, C-4 or C-K? C-4's the big one. C-Ks, yeah, and then after that I got caught in that, so it took about four or five person to get me out of there, you know. My skirt was torn, you know. And so, and they said I had to wear pants, and I was not the type that wear pants, was only in skirts at that time. So she said, so he said, you have to wear pants. I said, okay, I’m going to wear shorts. And I was the youngest one of the place, so they took measurement, how far I can, my shorts an be worn, you know, they measured. Oh, but poor Mr. Michel, oh, we had fun with him, oh. Like Ray Berube, I don’t know if you ever heard of him. Oh, he was a hellion, oh, he used, he’d sit me on a box of bobbins there, on top. I was small at that time, only 98 pounds, so he’d sit me on the box of bobbin and he said, so the boss come by, get down here. Well, I can’t get down, I (unintelligible word) jumped up, I said, they put me up here. So, and he used to, oh, fool around, him. Oh, the things he did in that place. But he was a good worker, a good weaver. I got him in the movies also, yeah. I’ve known him since I was a little girl, a baby I think. But yeah, that was a fun room to work. We had Christmas parties and, you know, and so they brought, everybody brought something, so we had good times. The people were nice in there. And in fact I have some friends, I still see a lot of the people that I, we used to work with, you know. Even the guy that I was, he was my weaver and I was his battery hand, you know, also with him, so I see them, too, also again. And they are, they were, I call them my friends because they, you know, I had a good time with them, and I worked, and they help me out too, also, you know. It was good. I enjoyed that room more than the Number One and Two. Number One and Two, the people was not as friendly as Number Five, you know, Number Five weave was the best room. And the cloth room, well that was something else, too, you know. But as far as the dust and the, we had to clean, in the fringe department we had to take a vacuum and clean the, they had eye thing to put your yarn that was going straight, you know, to, (unintelligible word) weaving in a way, they were (unintelligible word) fringe department. So the boss told me I had to clean, and so that day I was so tired, we had Roger Boyd, we had (name), he was my operator, and so we had Albert, the single old man, you know, he was older. So sometimes I got the yarn pulled in, in the vacuum, sometimes I did it on purpose just so at the end, when I did it on purpose to get the yarn in there so, and you had to pull it out after you turn the thing off, and I said, well, he said, well, I think you better stop cleaning. But that was a job. We had to clean all that, you know, all the machines, you know, all the eye things, so, that was too much. So when I said, well, I said, I think we better, he said, and he said, we better stop at it, you know. And I used to read lips. I have a daughter that I adopted that’s deaf, you know, so the boss started turning their back to me because I could read their lips, whatever they were saying. I was, I still am partly that way. We think young, even though we’re seventy-one, like my friend is seventy-five, we still think young. We don’t think as we are now, the age we are, we don’t think of the age. We think when we’re young. But I was mischievous, too. So one time I was chewing bubble gum and I was making noise, you know, with the bubbles, so the boss told me to cut it out. Well I said, you’re interfering with your chewing gum now. Oh, I was, I was a hellion, too, in a way, you know. Not as much as the guys was, but I used to, you know. But that’s another room that I had a good time with the people, you know. And in fact I met one, Virginia, she’s going to Florida, she said, for three weeks. And I met her, and she’s seventy-nine now, and she looks good for her age, you know. So, I mean, it’s all people that I worked with. 5 Well, there’s a lot of bad stuff, I’m not telling you all the bad stuff that happened. Oh, one time, oh my gosh, one time, I started having white hair when I was fourteen, you know. And so the top was all white, so, and I had a friend so we bought a dye, and she said, bring the dye in, we’ll do it for you, I’ll do it in the mill. So I went, we caught up with our job, you know, and I bring it, we do that. So when the boss, I’ll never forget it, he’s superintendent there at the, now, I think he’s changed job now. He worked in North Carolina for a while, and Norman Levasseur, he was my supervisor. And he says, so I got the rinse so everybody was watching for him, so, even the guys, the fixer. So, and then I, we had a room, so I had to wait in there so (unintelligible phrase) stuff, then we went to the sink in the hallway and then rinse it out. And then after that the boss got on top of, he was looking, and I was scooching down, we had three rolls to pull up, you know, yarn, you know, the cones. So, and he says, then he got in front of the step, because I had to climb up to put the things on, and he says, he was looking and I was laughing like hell, and he said, whatever you did, don’t do it again. He knew I had a white spot, then it disappeared, it was black. That’s what happened in the fringe and, oh, we used, we had fun in that room, we had a lot of fun there, so, yeah. It’s, memories, oh, I have a lot more stuff, it will take you the whole day to hear everything (unintelligible phrase). One time we had, Dick Ricker was also a supervisor there, and we dress up for Halloween. Over there you dress up for Halloween, and Christmas, you had to decorate your place, your lights, you know, flourescent light, we had to decorate all that. And then we exchange gift, and everybody ordered something like country, not country, chicken, oh, voyons, a senior moment, you know. You know, the chicken, the fried chicken there?"
"AL:","Kentucky Fried Chicken?"
"LM:","Yeah, so we all, everybody had that, and they all brought that in, you know. So we, so it was good in a way that everybody had the same thing to eat, and we all sit down, took a break. So one time for Halloween everybody dressed up, you know, for Halloween, and so I was dressed as a witch, I think we were three witches in there. So with the supervisor, nobody had their teeth in, they took out their false teeth, and I took mine out, too, and I, I still have a picture of that. Even the supervisor, so you can see it was a friendly thing in a way, because even the supervisors, as long as the people enjoyed the, you know, enjoyed working there. When I went to work over here, at the (name) Press, there, after they closed out there, I missed the Bates Mill. I always said that you, you know, you appreciate more what you had. You complained, but yet at the same time you appreciate what you were doing. I would prefer Bates Mill than this any time, you know. So, and I said, that’s the thing that people didn’t appreciate what they did. One man complained and he said, oh, the Bates Mill is like this, the Bates Mill is like that. I said, I guess you sit your ass over here on the bench but you’re not working, doing anything. Go to work somewhere else and you’ll find out you’ll be working and you won’t like it either, you’ll appreciate the mill more than that, you know. So that’s what I told him, that time. I was not shy of saying what I thought, you know."
"AL:","Do you remember when the mills sponsored Maurice Chevalier?"
"LM:","Oh yes, I’ve got the magazine, 1966, I’ve got the book over here. Matter of fact, I’m supposed to bring it down, and there’s a twenty five years people, because I was out sick and Norman, my boss, called me up and he said, you can come over, and he said, I got tickets for you to come over, you can go over there. And I was out on sick leave, and that’s what he did, you know, so we, I went over, and I got the magazine over here, a small magazine. It was 1966. Because I look at it, and I (unintelligible word) terrific, and the name of the people, you know, is on it, and the pictures, you know. I got that to bring down there. Oh yes, oh, Maurice Chevalier, that’s one of my favorite, one of my favorite."
"AL:","Now, at the time you were working at the mill, did they still do the annual picnic in the summer? 6"
"LM:","Yes they did, yes they did, when we were there, yes, every time they had. That was a nice thing to do, they had the meal and everything. And they had a band that played music, also, you know. It was really nice. Like I said, we didn’t appreciate what we had then, but you do after. You do after. I enjoyed the place, really. And I even told them over here, where the new job I had, I told the boss, I was not shy, you know, and I said, you know, if the Bates Mill would call me today I’d leave this place and go right there now. That’s how I felt, you know. So, it’s the truth, I mean, you know, it’s, it was easier, I damage more my hands over here than I did at the mill, you know, so. Over there the, over there what you had, you could bring your lunch and you, like I had a box to bring my tea or coffee, you know, and stuff like that. That I did down in the fringe, you know. And so you can bring anything you wanted, and can cook it over there, you know, they have oven or so to do that. But some type of little stove, you know, to get things ready. And I had a little stove to cook my stuff on, like the soup, you know, and just warm it up and stuff like that, or the water for tea or coffee, you know. That’s what we did at that time. Well, the mill was, you know, it, we worked hard in a way, but yet at the same time, it was really great. (Pause in taping.)"
"AL:","And I wanted to ask you about whether you had an opportunity to get involved in some of the recreational activities that were sponsored by the mills, like the bowling league, or?"
"LM:","Oh yes, I was on the bowling league, yes. We have, I’ve got pictures of that now, so, of the bowling league, with the people, yes, we celebrated. I always called my husband, though, I said, Gil, we’re gonna be done eating now, so you can meet us over here. Because I didn’t want him to be jealous or anything, than stay alone. And one time, I’ll never forget that, the girls was, the girls, we went to, after we ate we always went something else. There was a beer joint, I call it a beer joint, at the corner of, oh, it was right after you pass the bridge, where the Empire Bridge, there, it was right on the corner on your left if you’re going towards Auburn. And we used to stop over there, too. They did. I mean, I was not the type to go there, but I did because it was with a group. And so one time we landed up with a Detective Cloutier, and I said, all the girls were there when Germaine Guay, yeah, Guay, was, that was her brother. And so we went over there, it was four o’clock in the morning and I said, look, I was the only one that didn’t drink so, and I brought them home after, you know. So, and I said, look, if you don’t want them to stay over here overnight, I said, I’m leaving now and you’re going to bring them home. I said, either they go home now, or anything. So anyhow, I had to bring the girls home, so I was not that lucky to get away from it, so. So I, I told my husband, if you’d come in at four o’clock in the morning, I’d kill you. You, I don’t trust, but me, I trust me. I used to say that, you know, and I still do say it sometimes, you know. I say, see my little nose there? That’s as far as I trust you, so. Oh, I have fun. You have to have a sense of humor in life. If you don’t, you know. Now, getting back to Muskie, there, I had my picture taken with him at the convention we had at the Bates Mill, we had a picnic thing, so, so it was a convention. I forgot the year now that was, so, and a couple of time I met some people, they told me, oh, I see your picture with Muskie in the Icon. I’ve got the big picture here, too. And they said, it’s at the Bates College. I’d say, it is? Hmmm, I didn’t think I was that popular, you know. But it was up there, and I had a hamburger in my hand, and I put it behind me, so, but we had our picture taken. Olympia Snowe, I had my picture taken with her an awful lot. So the people that came in. I was active in the, I was in the bowling league, and also we were in a group and just after (unintelligible phrase), I forgot what we called it. If there was any problem that we had a meeting with Ray Bissonette and other people, you know, from different departments, and they would discuss what was wrong, what should be, you know, going on. So I worked in a group like that also. 7 And one time we had a State parade, and they made me a dress out of the corded blankets, there, and we were in the State parade. Ray was supposed to be my, Ray Bissonette was supposed to be my husband and he had a vest, I mean a jacket, smoking jacket on, and I had that full dress."
"AL:","And what’s his last name?"
"LM:","Ray Bissonette, yeah Bissonette, and so we were in a float, you know, for the parade, the State parade, I was involved in that. And I had a mouth, if I was not happy, I almost got to be a shop steward one time because, I didn’t get, and I was glad, too, because it was too big, too much, you know, with the kids, I had six, seven kids over here, one adopted so, I had six but we had seven in all. So, and I said, it would have been too much. But if I didn’t like anything, oh, what was his name again? I know, I got it there, the one with the union, the head of the union at that time, and I used to jump on his back all the time. I’d say what should be, what shouldn’t be, you know, so, win our case over there."
"AL:","Not the, the regional agent was Denis Blais."
"LM:","Denis Blais, but it’s not him that we, it was the other one that was the head of the shop steward there."
"AL:","Gosselin?"
"LM:","No. If I hear his name I know I’d hear it. Cloutier, I think? No?"
"AL:","Maybe, I don’t know."
"LM:","I, gosh, forgot his name."
"AL:","That’s okay."
"LM:","Out of sight, out of mind I guess."
"AL:","Do you recall any strikes at the mill while you were there?"
"LM:","Oh yes, there was a strike there, yeah, a couple times that we had strikes in there. But I didn’t, I didn’t get involved too much. I went to the meeting, and there was a time that I never went to meetings because with the big family I had, you know, I had to take care of that. But there were, yeah, we had strikes, but like I said, I didn’t, I went to a meeting one time. And I think we won our case. Yeah, we won that time. So, but I didn’t go for it too much, you know. I was not the type of person that went for the strike, because you lose your job and all that. But we did gain anyhow, whatever we went for. I don’t remember what it is today."
"AL:","Wages? There were wage increases?"
"LM:","Yeah, wages, insurance especially, you know, insurance, yeah. At the end they had, we had the cards with our name on it, punching, you know, that was something new they started, which was good, you know. That way you didn’t, you were on time. I was always on time. I was half an hour earlier than I was supposed to be. And that’s still the same thing over here, too. So, I’m the type of person that, doctors, hairdressers, and church, you can’t be late, you have to be on time. Ahead of time, half an hour."
"AL:","Now, did you say that your husband also worked in the mill?"
"LM:","Yes, he did. Not as much as I did, but he worked at the Hill Mill a little bit, and then, he was doing two or three jobs at that time, when he was doing that. Then he went to work at Bates as a weaver, and then he fixed the problem, he has an intelligent mind, you know, so he could fix his work, you know. He 8 wanted to do that, but then he didn’t stay there too long. He got to be a carpenter after that. He’s the one that did all this here, the kitchen. So, no, so after that he stopped that and then he work, couldn’t see it. And my kids, I told them, go to school or otherwise you’ll end up working in textile mill or shoe shops or anything. Which now we don’t have anything left anyhow, the shoe shops and all that, so, the mill. It’s a sad sight to see the mill all down. There used to be Hill blocks, that, I look for pictures like that, the Hill block. The Sun and Journal must have pictures, because it’s been, because I told her, I told her, I said, you know, there’s some pictures of the Hill block, and which I don’t see it. And, because there was a lot, you know, we used to stay there, too, a little bit when we were kids, younger."
"AL:","Now, when you worked at the mill, what shift did you work on?"
"LM:","First I started on third shift, and I got sick to my stomach, I couldn’t work on such a, I (unintelligible word) quite a bit over there on the third shift. Then I tried to, you have to sign up for a job, you know, for any other shift you wanted, you know. If you were next, you could get it. Then I went to a second shift, and I was a lot of years on second shift until, wait a minute, how old was the youngest one? I was here when we, yeah, let’s see, it was the second shift a long time, and then I finally got to be on the first shift. So that was the better shift to work on, you know. But second shift, I’d been years on it, I always worked on second shift, I was used to it. Because he worked third shift or first shift, and I worked second. Because I told him, you can’t take the, when he went to the mill, I said, you can’t be the same shift as I am, you have to do a different one. You can’t take second either, because I’m on second. So, I didn’t want to change, you know."
"AL:","Yeah, because raising your family, you couldn’t both be on the same shift."
"LM:","No, no, so it would have (unintelligible phrase). I used to spend ten dollars a week for a babysitter, compared to what they do today? My God, what a difference. We didn’t make much at that time, but wages wasn’t high like it is today, but things wasn’t expensive like today either, you know. So that’s a big difference there. But yeah, he did work in the mill a little bit, but not too long, though, because he, and after that he started to be a carpenter. So that’s what he’d been doing. Now he’s retired, we’re both retired. Not retarded, retired."
"AL:","Now, looking back on your time at the mill, is there anything that I haven’t asked you about that you think is important to add?"
"LM:","You know, sometimes when we do something like this then we always thing after you’re gone, well, I should have said this, I should have said that, you know. Sometimes (unintelligible phrase) quickly, it’s, I think we talked about all the departments that I worked in, and the people. I see Jack Russell, he’s 90 years old, he was a supervisor also, it’s a really nice man, he was in the cloth room. And I see him once or twice a year, I see him with his wife. Beautiful people."
"AL:","And did you know Fred Lebel?"
"LM:","Oh yes, Fred Lebel, yes, I knew him. Really nice, really nice man. And I met his sister-in-law. His wife, I don’t remember if I’ve ever seen her, but I don’t remember. But his sister-in-law Sandy, I know here real well. And Fred, oh yes, very pleasant, he always tells you hi, you know. Even today, you know, if you see him he says, hi, how are you, you know. And what’s his name, and Burgess, Larry Burgess always called me Lilly Ann, you know, pronounced the Ann, you know, more than anything. I like that, too, so, the way it was. It was really a nice place. Phil Morrow, runs the credit union there, so he worked there, too. We see each other once in a while, you know. I see a lot of people that, like I said, that we worked together, and it was really fun. As far as the, if I forgot anything, I don’t know if we did. 9"
"AL:","Any funny stories that you haven’t told yet?"
"LM:","Oh my gosh. I used to, I remember I used to help Ray Berube do his, he was a, he had eight kids I think, and I think it was mostly all girls. And he used to take airplane lessons, you know, so in the weave room, well we always, we were sitting down on our break and then I help him, ask questions about him driving a plane. And he was a skater also. Never went in his plane. I wouldn’t have either. But he, and that’s one room. Oh, stories, we have Gerry Laliberte that, and I don’t remember them, though, he used to tell us jokes all the time. Oh, that guy. He’s passed away, now, though, last year I think he did. And he always tells us jokes. And I had a very good friend Anita. There was two women who brought wine, not wine, brandy, you know, to, for Friday night, we had, we all did supper and, you know, the boss let us do that, and those girls had wine with foil covered on it. That was a no-no, but still they did that. And so one time they gave us, gave Gerry a cup, a little bit, and so I had, so they gave me a sip, so I took a sip, Gerry gave me that, and then my friend Anita, Anita (name), she went over and he says, here, try it, Anita. So she took the cup and walk away with it. She drank it all. That’s one thing that happened. Oh, there’s a lot of little things that happened that we remember, you know, but sometimes you forget it. You have to think about it, you know. Senior moment is very easy to get, you know, today. Out of sight, out of mind, it’s even worse. What else, what else? As far as the picnic, we had quite good picnics, and we had, oh, they had a ballroom, they had an orchestra one time for dancing, you know, and a supper and all that, we had that, too. It happened, I don’t remember the year now, I forgot it. I think we had it only once, if I remember correctly, while I was there. But the seniors, the one that twenty-five years got a lot of celebration, you know, every time they were twenty five or over they got celebration and a pin. I got my twenty-five year pin, also, over there. What else, what else? The weave room, the Number Five, like I said, was the best one. And Number One and Two was not as great as the others. But that’s the shift I got sick a lot, that’s where I worked, in Number One and Two when I was on third shift."
"AL:","Did you know any of the employees that were on the famous hockey team?"
"LM:","No, because I was not too much in it as, I was not a, didn’t have time for sports, you know, with my kids, eh, so, all I know is, no, we didn’t, we took movies of (unintelligible phrase). Especially Christmas, we have Joe Gravel, who was also a supervisor, and Roger (name) who dressed up as Santa Claus, you know, we were a group of people in the Number Five, you know, they took our picture there, so. I still have that, that shot, I have that. I should give that to the Bates, because the kids won’t remember the people, you know, that’s in there. If you’re not in the picture, you know, they won’t remember it. Still, they won’t keep that because be all strangers to them, you know. But I’d like to give that, have a tape, I don’t know anybody who does a copy of the video that I have. We took the movies, we put it on video, of the Bates Mill, you know, with the group there. Do you know anybody?"
"AL:","I will talk to Rachel about that."
"LM:","Yeah, because I like to have, I like to give that to the Bates. It would be nice if they had that, that section of the Bates Mill with Ray, and there was Paul Bernier. He walked pretty fast, I saw him, he walked pretty fast, you know. But Ray, you could see him good, and me, you could see me feeding, getting ready to feed the machine there, the battery hand in Number Five there. So, but as far as jokes, I don’t remember, too. I’m not a good joke teller, but I like to hear them, you know. I don’t know what else we could say about the place, except I loved it. Thinking about it now in the past, there, talking about it reminds me of a lot of stuff, you know, that we did over there, we 10 worked over there. Except my partner on the sealer was Lorraine Demers, she was a single woman. And her, she went, every time she buys a sandwich she just took a bite off of it and throw it away in the trash after. And I said, do you know there’s a lot of poor people are going hungry, and I said, they’re starving and you take that sandwich and throw it away? You wasted it? So I kept on and on, and then she, she put her hand like this, she goes in the trashcan, she said, here’s the sandwich, eat it now. So the women next to me, a sealer, Anna and Bertha, they took the sandwich and put it on the side of the window to feed the pigeons. Oh, I’ll never forget her. She used to smoke an awful lot, oh, God, she’s a smoker. But that was my partner to work with, you know. We had fun over there, too. Oh, my gosh. I had a lot of bad things in there, too, so."
"AL:","Thank you very much for your time."
"LM:","You’re very welcome."
