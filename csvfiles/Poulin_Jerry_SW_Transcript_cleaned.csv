"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) April 2, 2010 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Workers Oral History Project at the Museum L-A. The date is April 2nd, 2010, this is Andrea L'Hommedieu and today I'm interviewing Jerry Poulin in Auburn , Maine. Jerry, could you start just by saying your full name? Jerry Poulin: Well, my real name is Richard but nobody knows me as Richard, it's Jerry, everybody knows me as Jerry Poulin."
"AL:","Is that with a G or a J?"
"JP:","With a J."
"AL:","J-E-R-R-Y."
"JP:","Right, and also, I've been in the shoe industry for thirty-five years."
"AL:","Thirty-five. What's your date of birth?"
"JP:","7/20/37"
"AL:","And were you born in the Lewiston-Auburn area?"
"JP:","Yes."
"AL:","And did you grow up here?"
"JP:","Yes."
"AL:","Can you talk about what the Lewiston-Auburn area was like in the forties and the fifties, when you were growing up?"
"JP:","In the forties actually, we were just coming out of the war so things were still very hard, because all the servicemen were coming home, they needed jobs, just like anybody else. Needed housing . So it was more or less difficult time, but we managed through. And it was like a wake-up call for us, shall we say, I feel. Then in the fifties, that's when I went to work. I think it was 1952 is when I went to work for Mr. Koss."
"AL:","That would have been at like age fifteen?"
"JP:","Sixteen, I had just, well I had a couple of weeks in there but, you 're right, and I stayed , I was the last man when they locked the door. I don't know if was twenty-two years, must have been twenty years, because it was 1972, if I remember right, when Koss Shoe, manufacturing stopped , and the old man wouldn 't let me go. I sat in that factory, empty, that's the Barker Mill, right here in Auburn , that was Koss Shoe. But we used to be on Hutchinson Street in Auburn first, moved over there. I sat in that factory for three months, did nothing, I was alone, entertaining Mr. Koss. He'd come in , and I had to be there every Sunday, that was his ritual."
"AL:","Now, when you say Mr. Koss, which Mr. Koss?"
"JP:","Senior. The other Koss is Herbie, the boy, my little boy, I used to call him my little boy, because I was so small and he was a giant. So anyways, in between , he promoted me from sweeping the floor in the warehouse to the head of leather, which is the money-maker for a factory . If the leather's not proper, you lose money. That was my job, sorting the leather, grading it out, and -"
"AL:","Were you also the one buying it?"
"JP:","He'd go, Mr. Koss would go to Boston , or to the big leather shows, he'd buy some leather, overnight delivery to the factory for me to look at. I'd grade it all out, mark it down , and it was relayed back to him, my opinion of what it looked like. Well , first thing I knew, four hundred bags would come in. Railroad cars, now, from the Grand Trunk, and these bags weighed three hundred and fifty pounds, of leather. So then he'd come in like a week later, and I had to spot check different bags, to make sure my calculation was right. And (unintelligible) he was very, very pleased. And like I said , he just, I went to that to, I took over three departments, had a hard time because I was at that time probably twenty-five, twenty-six, and all the people that were working under me were in their forties, fifties and sixties, and they'd been there for years. So it was difficult on me, I think it was more difficult on them having some young guy tell them what to do. It's hard . I mean it would be hard on me if I'd been there for thirty years and have some young person, who's now a head supervisor, tell me what to do, you know? But there was always, in any factory, including Koss Shoe Company, that had what they called leaders, just one person would control probably about ten people, we're going to do it this way and that's it. So when I took over, I had to pick out those leaders, and fire them . One of the men , that I will not name, though the whole fam ily's dead now anyway, I let him go, he'd been there for, oh, I'd say thirty years, he went right up to Mr. Koss' office and really lit into it with Mr. Koss, about this young so-and-so downstairs just letting me go. Mr. Koss called me on the phone, well I had a number, it was bell, all through the factory , I heard my bell and, oh , that's for me. I went up to see Mr. Koss and he says, look, Jerry, he says, what's wrong, so-and-so, no name, so-and-so here said you just released him. I said yes. You told me I was the boss. Yup. I don't need him. That's it, Jerry, so-and-so, I'm sorry, but Jerry let you go, I can't help you. And that was it. So what I'm saying is that he always stood up behind me, Mr. Koss. Wouldn't back down for nothing. I mean it wasn't all smooth, it was very rough with him, he was a very, very strict man, demanding. How else would I say that, also he was very ~ generous, money wise, he gave millions away. I've seen him, like when a leather salesman would come in , I'd go with Mr. Koss, and go on the elevator with him , because it was six floors, and we'd walk around, the salesman would say- they always called him Joe, because that was his name, Joseph Koss, so business wise it was Joe. Far as I was concerned, it was Mr. Koss. I seen the old man , Mr. Koss, shake a man's hand , salesman, on a million dollars of leather. Handshake. Send it to me and I'll send you a check. Done. Today, you can't do that. No, you got to sign fourteen thousand documents and give me half down. No, pay in thirty days, no, not that, handshake. A million dollars. I almost fell of the elevator. That's the difference, you know. ~ I had people working for me, minimum wage, for twenty years. For twenty years. And they were happy. But when you was getting seventy-five cents an hour, eighty cents an hour when it went up, oh boy, it was unbelievable, you lived very well on that money. When I got married, I was making sixty-five dollars a week, because I was going up in authority, which was good money. I got married on that and had a child on that, but our grocery bill was ten dollars a week, that's the difference. Our rent was eight dollars a week. We had surplus money. Not today."
"AL:","Now it's very different. Before we go more on to your work in the shoe industry, I want to step back and talk about, because it's important to capture a sense of the community history as well, and talk a little bit about the family you grew up in and what the town was like when you were growing up. Can you tell the names of your parents and how many brothers and sisters you had?"
"JP:","I had, there was four of us, I have two brothers and a sister. I was the baby, I was the baby, I was seven years younger than my sister, which was the third one down . So like she's eighty right now and I'm seventy-three, and then each one of them was a , year apart, and the two boys were in the service. And Lewiston, Lisbon Street, Main Street, you couldn 't walk on it, there were so many people. Businesses were unbelievable, they had something like, I think like twenty-six buses that would line up on Lisbon Street, Main Street going up, and in front of Peck's across the street. And they had a, I called him a bus starter, he was the one who blew the whistle, he'd go out in the street, and all the buses had to move at the same time, so the scheduling was perfect. You could go all over the twin cities, including Sabattus for a nickel, five cents, then it went up finally to probably a quarter or -(telephone interruption)."
"AL:","So you were saying, the buses all lined up and for a nickel you could go anywhere."
"JP:","Yeah, anywheres, nickel, five cents. And let's say if you was going from upper Sabattus Street, you always end up on same spot, Lisbon and Main in front of Peck's, that's where they stopped. And they'd give you a little paper transfer, tear it off, then you go get on the other bus that said like, where I used to live, Prospect Hill, New Auburn , you get on the bus, give it to the bus driver, didn't cost you nothing, but that nickel took you into that, all the way up, and they dropped you off in front of your house. Not today, they bring you to one spot and they drop you off, you walk. No, not then, no. And the people would come in, mainly from Berlin, New Hampshire, to do their shopping, because at that time, in the fifties, early sixties, we were like the key of all the buying as far as household goods and , I mean every store was full. And there wasn't fifty million cars either, that's what the bus service was for, and people would come in, sometimes by the railroad , Maine Central, or the Grand Trunk, out of Berlin, New Hampshire, and come in . That's where I met my first girlfriend. How's that, see? My first girlfriend. So it was super busy, nice people. You didn't see drugs on the street or drunks walking around, it was nice, nice people. And they used to have like Mr. Peanut, right on the corner of Main and Lisbon there was a store, today it's I think Dostie's Jewelry store, they used to sell peanuts, cashews and stuff like that, fresh. Out front, the guy was, you know, on the Planter's Peanuts, he's got a hat and he's a peanut and he's got a cane? He was in front of there. I mean, he'd walk around , offer you peanuts. That's nice stuff, you know, you don't see that today, no-no, no. And , oh God, I'm trying to think, it's difficult, you know."
"AL:","At Christmas time, did one of the department stores, I think I remember people said they made a big deal, do you have any recollections of that? It might have been Peck's ."
"JP:","It was probably Peck's, yeah , that's the only place, it was like today buying from Filene's, that they have in New York. They had the highest fashions, and that's the only place my mother would buy her clothing, from underpants to corsets, you know, I used to have to, I'd help her sometimes in the morning , when she'd go to work."
"AL:","What did your parents do for work?"
"JP:","My mother worked for Knapp Shoe in Lewiston as a top stitcher, that's when I found out about stretching. Remember I told you earlier, stretching the things, how you can stretch the machine? I mean, I was a kid when my mother told me, if I want to make some extra money, if I don't get caught, I'd stretch it, but she explained what it was. Now, when I grew up and went into the factories, aha, that was twenty years ago, and she wasn 't lying, they still do it today. Especially today, when they're using that nylon thread , you could stretch it and it won't break. In her time, it was mostly cotton , so if you pulled it too hard on the machine you'd break it. So, see, there's all of that that falls into it, I mean th is can go on and on and on , I mean I cou ld go on for hours."
"AL:","Well talk to me about the measurement, the inch and the stitching."
"JP:","I might have one someplace in the house here."
"AL:","But can you describe it to me on tape?"
"JP:","Yeah, it's shaped like a half moon, visualize a half moon , and the curl was exactly one inch."
"AL:","So two very precise points on each end."
"JP:","Correct, and you could stick it right on there and you count the stitches in between and that would tell you. Then they had another one, it was the same thing, but they had a mark in the middle, which went to the half inch, but it was very hard because it's, it was up in the air, it was about this big, you know, so if you got a mark up here, how do you count, where does it stop right in the middle. So we all depended on that, you just stick down, it was very simple. Like, see, on th is, at that time-"
"AL:","Now, you 're showing me a baby shoe. 6J! JP: On a standard shoe you can count the stitches. On this baby, I don't know how an operator would stitch that many stitches in such a small area. And if you took a magnifying glass and you looked at that, it's unbelievable, unbelievable. See, this was made inside out, like a stocking , see, that's why you don't see no seam here. It was in reverse, you know, they'd stitch it, turn it around , all of th is was made first, okay, hooked to the upper, then they'd reverse it, stitch this on, pop it back and then that was the baby right there/ 1put this in here so that it doesn't collapse. Now, I had a perfect pair and I can't find the other one, because since we moved everything has been so upside down. I know, I think I sold them to, I had some local women's high fashion shoes here too, high button, and in fact my daughter used to put them on, it was funny. And they were selling for, they were very expensive, like nineteen or twenty dollars. They were beautiful , they were this color, I forget the name, taupe, but they were this tall, all high buttons, they had a hook, you know, hook them up. I probably have some of them too someplace."
"AL:","And so you were also saying that the price of shoes depended somewhat on the amount of stitching?"
"JP:","That's right, when the factory would figure the price of manufacturing , that's how we figured the price to pay you, the operator. But the buyer said , I got to have at least, for a quality shoe, like if you 're making a Florsheim shoe, the more stitches per inch , that's a high quality shoe. You can take that same shoe and degrade it by stretching the stitches. So that now when you walk, the stitches kind of separate a little bit, you know. Where you take a high grade shoe, you can wear it for a year, and you look at it and the lines are all nice, same thing, perfect. So when the manufacturer had to price a shoe for manufacturing, he had to know everything about it, including the stitches, how many can we get out of it, and so that when he goes to the operator he can say, look, this new shoe is going to pay two cents a pair for you to stitch, which would be twenty- four cents a case. And let me tell you , those women could budge through those cases fast, you wouldn 't believe it. When you see needles on a machine smoking, they literally smoked , those needles were so hot. Sometimes they'd break off and hit a woman in the hand , right through it, just like it was nothing. I seen a lot of damage in the factory."
"AL:","Dangerous, yeah ."
"JP:","Dangerous, fingers cut off on the cutting machines. I won't go into detail, but boy, there were some good ones, yeah, really, really, really bad , you know."
"AL:","And this was before OSHA? I mean were there outside agencies that came in and checked for safety, or was it all in-house?"
"JP:","All in-house, yeah . See, then OSHA didn't exist, which actually hurts a company more. It's easier, my opinion , this is my personal opinion, my opinion , if OSHA wouldn 't stick their nose in, if one of your workers fell , got killed , it's really too bad, but the company's able to pay the family very well and it's settled . But now if a person gets maimed or hurt or killed on a job, OSHA comes in and fines the factory thousands of dollars, and makes all these changes now, you can 't restart until you have these harnesses, you can 't have this, that hurts a company, when they're working on a margin of failure or profit, OSHA comes in and kills them , and it don't take long . So that's what I'm saying , that was my personal opinion. And just like lately, in fact you shouldn't put it on there, you asked what my mother did . I don't know my father, that's why I didn't throw it in , but I know my biological father, okay. That's why I (unintelligible) , a redhead , this one, okay. No name, but that's, my mother told me quickly, in plain English , who this person was. Come to find out it was Joe Koss' best friend. Wow. Yeah, so I always put my mind that that's why- the Jewish people helped themselves. If you 're a Jew, and I'm a Jewish business person , and you're in financial problems, he's going to pull you out of it. He's not going to see you sink. Or he will or somebody else will, but they keep it in the group, which is, that's business, that's good business too. So if an illegitimate child someplace in the Jewish community, shall we say, they make sure that that illegitimate ch ild is well taken care of. Not financially, not big money, but given a good job, watched over, you know, this and that. And that's where I came in, and that's why, we felt that's why Mr. Koss pushed me, because this person must have spoken with him and said, hey look, what do I do. I'll take care of him. So. Now, I'm going to show you, if I can find one piece of paper, you 'll have to shut that off for one minute. (Pause in taping.)"
"JP:","We were talking about local?"
"AL:","Well, we were talking about- (taping paused) . Now, you said you grew up in New Auburn, is that where your family home was?"
"JP:","Yes."
"AL:","What did you guys do when you were still kids, before you went to work in the shoe shops, what did you do for fun , what sort of things, were there lots of kids around , was it a big neighborhood? Give me a sense of that."
"JP:","Well, upper South Main Street was all the better area, okay. Like if you get down closer, like in Lewiston, same thing, Lincoln Street area was kind of iffy, you know, we didn't go there too much , Knox Street, rough. But where we were, we were at 159 South Main Street, that's way up over the hill. And anyways, what we used to play, like let's say there was probably ten of us kids in a pretty big area, there wasn't a lot of kids, and we used to play kick the can, you know, you put a can in the middle of the street, and we all go hide and somebody's got to come out someplace, try to kick that can for us, you know, then you run and hide again. Or you can go out and steal that can. Then stupid stuff like who could make the most noise at night. We'd kick the can and squash in on our foot, so that it kind of clamped around your shoe, and you 'd run down the road like a goddam horse with horseshoes, clop-clop-clop-clop. And it was just, oh, just stuff like that. We'd play, we were all given a piece of chalk, white chalk, and they had one pass out the chalk to everybody, you were alone with him, let's say there was six people, one would stay behind, pass five pieces of chalk out to each one of them, and then you had to turn around and all five of them disappeared . They could be anywhere, they could be up in a tree hiding, but as you went, you had to leave an arrow, visible from one arrow to another one as to where you were headed, or where you're going. So you pick up an arrow and you follow this one, and you look down, you lose it. Oh, there it is, over there, keep going. Now, it's dark outside, that's why you had to use a white chalk. And if we turned a corner, we'd mark it on a tree. And that game would last an hour, you know. But see, at that time we had curfew, and Lewiston was 9:15, and Auburn was 9:00, and let me tell you, if you were out there they would stop you and ask you where you were going . I'm going home, officer, going home. Oh yeah, (unintelligible) more times. Oh, gee whiz. Or we'd take the balloons, fill them up with water, the kids still do it today, and throw them at people. We'd hide in the bush and they'd go by, bam. Or take a dollar bill, if we could get a dollar bill , and hook it to a piece of cord, not cord but thread , put it on the sidewalk. They'd kick it with their foot, yeah, that's a rea l dollar, just take it on reflex, then you 'd get up and run . But those are nice games, you know. In fact Jimmy, next door, he was mentioning that I think last week, that, remember that, Jerry, he said , when we were kids. He's only, he just turned seventy, I think he's seventy or seventy- one, anyway, same group basically. I' And Mr. Dussault, that lives around the corner over here, there used to be a Dussault's Drug Store in New Auburn, before the big fire in '34 , the New Auburn fire , it burned everything down, actually he lost his store right off. The state immediately, before they did anything in New Auburn, they built his store. It was a drug store, people needed medication, see. So, he's still alive today, he's ninety-one years old , he was here yesterday. We go out, we travel the country in the summer time, you know, you wouldn 't believe it, he looks like a pin. You look at that man and you're going to say he's not sixty-five. His skin , perfect. And he dresses nicely, like, well he's worth millions, I know this. Every time he buys a new car, Jerry, I just bought a car, will you take me up to pick it up. Sure. I go up, that one right there? Yeah, he said , I just bought it, I come up to pay for it. Write a check, thirty-two thousand dollars, a check. Thanks for the ride, Jerry. Two years ago he went and bought himself a Toyota Avalon, that expensive one. It was in the mid thirty thousand range . I took him up to get it. I come back home, two days later he come over here, he says, Jerry, he says, I'm so damned impressed with that car, I just bought another one. For his wife. So I took him back up, now they got two in their garage. And I said, what are you going to do with your Buick? He had a '97 Buick Limited with every option you could think of, and in '97 he paid th irty-six thousand for that one. And it had fifty thousand miles on it, wasn't even broke in. No-no, he says, I'm going to sell it to you cheap. I said , you know what that thing is worth? He says, it's not what it's worth, it's what I want to sell it for. You're always helping me and this and that, he says, five thousand dollars too much , Jerry? Had a book of fourteen thousand . But he didn't want it, it was only money."
"AL:","He should be interviewed about his knowledge of the community over so many years as a small business man ."
"JP:","That man can name you every person in New Auburn, their parents, and where they live. He is one smart cookie. Brilliant, I mean his memory is unbelievable. Unbelievable, yeah."
"AL:","Now tell me, then when you were older and you were working in the shoe shop, as an adult, what did the people who worked in the shoe shops do for fun , did they have company things they did together, or was it -?"
"JP:","Oh yes, we had, I'm talking , well most all the factories , like Knapp Shoe Company used to, Knapp Shoe for instance, this is when I was real small, I used to go with my mother, and they went up to, busloads of us went up to, it was in Augusta , on the right hand side. Today it's gone, it was like a big play area, and there was water there, like a small pond or whatever, and they had free food and all kinds of cooking, games from chasing a greased pig to climbing the brass pole, and there was like a hundred dollar bill up there, and that was a lot of money, and you'd see those idiots trying to go up that pole. The pole was only about this big around . It's full of grease. They go like that, they never get off the ground. So a couple of them would get on their shoulder, so they were taller, but even if he was a foot from the top of that pole, as soon as that guy from underneath got out, whoosh, you were gone. Fun. And then as Knapp Shoe got- we 're now into the sixties, mid sixties -what was happening , well the imports were over taking and the factories were closing down. For a long time in Lewiston, if I remember right, there was like twenty-two or twenty-six factories in Lewiston-Auburn . There was a lot of them . And I knew all the guys anyways, you know, knew them all, because by associating with Koss. We would go out to dinner, and like the head honchos from Knapp Shoe Corporation would be there, we're all eating in a big round table, or it'll be at Stekino's, that was the hot spot then , Stekino's, that was Class A, shall we say. Big chandelier. ~ And so that's where it was, and then like we'll say Mr. Koss, on Easter Sunday, or for Easter weekend , he would call in , and they'd line up tables, on the way out the door, they'd line up all these tables, and everyone that went by got a ham, big ham, a dozen eggs, and a five-dollar bill. But what I'm saying is, that five-dollar bill was like two days pay, you know, plus a dozen eggs and a ham. And that was two hundred people he'd do that to. Thanksgiving, a turkey, a turkey and I know it was five dollars, but what else did he throw in there?"
"AL:","Potatoes?"
"JP:","Could have been, could have been, it's been too many years, you know. And then for Christmas, each supervisor had to take his whole crew out for dinner. And I've got some pictures, if I can only find them, and I want Herbie to see them before he's dead . And me too. Because, first we'd take the help, but I was in charge of three departments, so I had to go three times. And you were allowed anything you want and old Mr. Koss paid the bill. And then when it came for the executives, which was the owner, Herbie Koss, the son, the superintendent, and then the class went down this way, the further down the road you got on the table is the less authority you had, okay, it was like from one to ten , when I'm number one I'm over here. Well, nice big pictures that they had taken , we're all in, you know, dark suits, shirt and tie. Well, (unintelligible), it was an executive dinner. So Mr. Koss had just had his hemorrhoids repaired so he couldn 't show, so Bill Mooney, the superintendent, sat in Mr. Koss' chair, that was the head one right here, okay. Then as it went down the line, there was Herbie Koss right next to him, and right across was me. And I look like I was sixteen years old, and all these old duffers all the way down. There was only like probably fifteen , eighteen of us altogether. But I want Herbie to see that. And then we started a hockey team for the Twin City, Land A Shoe Workers Hockey Team, or something like that. That I've got pictures of, right up here. So I told Herbie, gee, that's good, but we need some outfits, we need some shirts and this and that. Geeze, he says, my father won 't go along with that one. He gave me the money out of his pocket, bought everything. And so we won , three years in a row, top spot. They were good , good. In fact, I've told Herbie, the last time I seen him, I think it was about a year ago, I bumped into him at Gipper's. He spotted me, I didn't spot him . And all of a sudden I heard him, and his voice don't change. I turn around , Herbie's sitting right over there. So anyways, like I told him , that if he would have taken the factory over from his father- he didn't like manufacturing, he liked business, importing, exporting , and he still does it today. So his father didn't close the factory, he just, how do you call it, sized it out, you know, as the orders were done, all manufacturing shipped out, he didn't take in any more orders, so after a wh ile there was nothing left in the factory . But I told Herbie, if that factory was still there today, I'd be there, definitely. I'd probably own it by now. No, it was very, very, I liked the shoe industry. They were all good people, and the workers were good people. They were, I'd say seventy percent of them were all drunks. I mean bad-"
"AL:","Alcoholism was prevalent, yeah ."
"JP:","Yes, and in fact every Monday I would have to, I'd have to go over to the jail and pay the bonds, whatever you call those, the bail, to get the guys out so they could go back to work."
"AL:","Were those mostly hand sewers, or all different positions?"
"JP:","All different positions, it was just in the group, that's the way they were, you know. Oh yeah. Then I had another group that were in jail, and I was allowed four workers on work release, so the sheriff would pick them up at the jail and bring them to me, and they'd punch in and they'd work for me, then at about two minutes of four in the evening you 'd see the sheriff's car pull up, all the guys wou ld get back in and go back to jail. I did that for a long time. And a lot of them were just stupid, they got ten days for drunken, oh , stupid stuff. There were no criminals that came in. And in time it changed so much, so much, that-"
"AL:","I mean, at that point it was, your workers were in high demand to meet your volume, right?"
"JP:","Oh yes."
"AL:","And then you must have seen that change over time."
"JP:","Yes."
"AL:","What did you see?"
"JP:","Well, Mr. Koss is the one that put me up to that one. He says, Jerry, shoe industry is gone, it's gone, forget it, you have to go into a new industry. He made the suggestion. You have to get into probably injection molding, which is a different animal, completely different animal. I don't know anything about it. You will, he says. This is on a Saturday morning now, and I can vouch for this, he picked up the phone, he called Miami, Florida, and somebody answered the phone down there- and what the hell's his first name, his last name was Shapiro, one of Mr. Koss' very close friends, he owned Bon-Ann Footwear right here in Auburn . The old man says to him , and I'm sitting right there, my right arm is the last man , I got to let him go and he's got to have a job. And I don't know what the conversation was. Okay, thanks, he'll be there. So Jerry, he says, Monday go over to Bon-Ann, you 're going to work. But, he said , you got a good position, you 're superintendent. That's crazy. Anyways, when I went in and introduced myself, I saw in the window a piece of paper, about this big, introducing themselves to me, that you are in here, coming in, it's very good, welcome. It was really something, you know. But I only lasted about a year, I couldn't stand it. Couldn't stand it, the smell in there was so bad, and hot. Injection molding is hot, very bad."
"AL:","And the smell, was it a glue or something?"
"JP:","No, it's like, what do you call it, it's fumes , if you will."
"AL:","Chemical fumes."
"JP:","Yeah, chemical, yeah, very, very strong. And those machines produce heat like you would not believe. And always had bomb threats out there, always bomb threats. If somebody wanted to shut the whole factory down, there was these large hoppers on top of the machines, big square hopper, that they'd pour the plastic into, the plastic beads, which would melt, come out through a big gun under high pressure and blow it into the last, and it made a sneaker, okay. What they'd do is, they'd take a nut or a bolt or a screw and throw it in the hopper. Well, that hopper was like a meat grinder, it had a big auger in it, okay, under very high pressure. Well that bolt would go right down and get jammed in that augur, and when you see the machine go er-er-er, you had to shut it off immediately and you had to get out of there. Because if that gun what they called blew, there's so much pressure, the end would come off just like a cannon. So you'd have to shut it off and run extra antifreeze in it, to cool it down as quick as you could. And it would take you five hours to fix it. Had to take the gun off, cool it down , drive that thing out of it. So I got sick of that, I said, this is stupid , nobody wants to work. So, that's how I shifted from Mr. Koss to Ernest, Ernie, Ernest Shapiro. And even after, I'd say for the next six months, the old man would call my house. Jerry, you going out of town. I said , yeah. Would you pick me up the same stuff? Sure, how many you want? Oh, just one. I'd come back. What it was, he drank a very expensive scotch, half gallons, and at that time was paying like thirty five bucks for a half gallon. I'd go in, (unintelligible) right away, you know. Every weekend I'd make sure, I'd make a special trip for him, you know. So anyways, Herbie had a bad deal , he bought some crappy shoes from Guatemala. They looked nice, until you started to walk on them . About two days later the sole would split right in half, it would literally split right here, across. So Herbie had like, I think was something like twenty-five thousand pair that came back to him. They were dead, they were no good . His father says, call Jerry, have him come down , we'll talk to him. So, I looked at the shoes, I said, holy cow, that's bad. He says, can you fix them? I said, you know I can fix anything, I said, but it's going to cost you . Not me, but you 're going to have to buy some new lightweight plantation crepe - no need of going into that with you- and I said , I'll fire up some of the machines down here. How much are you going to charge me, you know, for labor per pair- well, I won't go into that one. But anyways, they agreed, and I worked down there for probably, for at least a month, all by myself, and got them all fixed and ready, he sold every one of them, and they never come back. Oh yeah, because there was a lot of that that went on, you know."
"AL:","I know you have a million stories. Is there anything really outstanding that you want to add before we end today? I can always come back another day."
"JP:","Yeah , that'll be all right, if you don't mind. What I'll do th is time, I'll make a list of what I want to talk about, and I'll have the memory to back it up."
"AL:","That sounds wonderful."
"JP:","See, that's better than just grabbing stuff out of the sky."
"AL:","But thank you so much for today."
