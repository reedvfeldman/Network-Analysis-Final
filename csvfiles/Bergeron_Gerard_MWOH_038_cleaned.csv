"GB:","I was born here in Lewiston."

"GB:","Right."
"AL:","And your parents, what were their names?"
"GB:","My father’s name was Alexander Bergeron, my mother was, is a Lapointe, she’s from Canada, they both come from Canada."
"AL:","So they were born in Canada?"
"GB:","They were born in Canada. And the family was all born in Lewiston, my mother came to Lewiston with my father and they settled over here."
"AL:","And how many brothers and sisters did you have?"
"GB:","I have one brother, which lives in Oakland, California, and I have one sister here in Lewiston, and the others passed away."
"AL:","So how many children were there?"
"GB:","There was five of us."
"AL:","And why did your parents come to Maine from Canada, did they talk about it? 1"
"GB:","They come from St. Honore."
"AL:","And why, for work?"
"GB:","Well, they had to work, but about just the only thing they had around here was the mills at the time, when they came over. They came to work; they worked in the mills, yeah."
"AL:","What did they do in Canada? Don’t know?"
"GB:","They were both born on a farm, I can tell you that much. They were brought up on a farm."
"AL:","Now, what part of Lewiston did you live?"
"GB:","I lived on Donald Street, that’s up Thorn’s Corner. It’s about two, three miles from town here, and I went to Holy Family School, grammar school. And high school, I never finished high school, I quit while I was working on second shift at Bates, I quit. It was too much to work and go, so I quit. It’s too bad. Today I’m sorry that I didn’t keep going, but that’s the way it went. During the process of my time at Bates, I tried very hard to become a loom fixer. I was interested in becoming, I’d done just about every job in the weave room, worked my way up, and I was interested in becoming a loom fixer. I like mechanical work, so. But there was a, the overseer of the department at the time was a Mr. Malloy, Bill Malloy, and for some reason or other he never really liked me, you know. And I had a very hard time to get on to learn how to fix looms. And I could have done something about it because at the time I could have gone on the G.I. Bill, but I didn’t. I just said to myself, I’m going to find a way to get, to get, if I don’t become a fixer, I’ll find a way to get ahead of them. So that’s around in the 1960s, late ‘50s or early ‘60s, quite a while back. I noticed, I picked up in a magazine a correspondence school. I think it was from Scranton, Pennsylvania, IC-, it was International Correspondence School. So I started reading what they had for courses, and I noticed they had a loom fixer supervisor course on there, and it was a three and a half year course, it was quite a, so I told my wife, I’m going to try, I’m going to take that course. But I never told the company a word, I just took the course, and I was able to go through it in less than two years. And it took a while after I got my diploma, finally they reached me, the school reached me, asking me if they mind if I let Bates, the Bates Manufacturing Company, know that I have taken a course with them. So I says, well, I says, okay with me I guess, because I never said nothing to nobody. So they did call the company. The first thing I knew, I was called in the personnel office about the course, why didn’t you tell us? I says, I don’t know, it’s just immaterial, I didn’t, just never gave it a thought. She says, if you’d have told us we would have paid for your course. But they did offer to pay half, so I appreciated it. And, let’s see, -"
"AL:","So did that help you?"
"GB:","Oh, very much so."
"AL:","In what way?"
"GB:","Well, that’s how I became a supervisor. I worked about twenty-four years as a sma-, as, earlier like a fill in, they used to call them filling boys and bobbin boys and card boys. But they changed the rules, you have to call them a person, you know, so there won’t be no discrimination. Had to be a fill in person, a bobbin person and whatever. Like the room girls, they used to call them room girls but you couldn’t call them room girls any more, they were repair people, so they were repair girls, to repair 2 smashes and break outs, stuff like that. So they finally, so I, they spoke to me and they told me that, they paid for half the course. It took a little while longer after that, I was approached to be, if I would, they would like to have me be a supervisor. They told me, we like the way you work, and the way you produce, you always seem to try to produce more all the time, which that was my way. Weaving was piecework, so, and I weaved for twenty- four years, almost. The other jobs I didn’t stay too long on, I learned how to weave right away. And there was one particular fixer who helped me, weaver that helped me how to weave. His name was Roland Pruneau, and he helped me a lot, gave me a lot of tips, how to weave, and I learned a lot from him. And it didn’t take long, I was able to have my set of looms. And you know how it is in the old days, well, it’s still the same now, you have to, you know, build your seniority, you want to make sure you do good, you don’t want to quit, you know, you want to keep the seniority build up. In 1944 I went into the service, in ‘44, and I was in the service two and a half years, I was in the Air Force. And I enjoyed my service time very much. And I never was called to active duty, I was one of the lucky ones that the atom bomb saved me from going on active duty at the time. You know, they say (unintelligible word) it saved thousands of people and thousands of service people. It’s too bad. Today you talk about those things to the younger generation, they can’t seem to understand it very good. I don’t know why, if they don’t teach it more in the schools. Some of them think we should have never dropped the atom bomb there, and they’re wrong. If Japan would have had the atom bomb, they wouldn’t have hesitated to drop it on us. They’re the ones that put the knife into our backs when they invaded, attacked Pearl Harbor, so we had a pretty good excuse to stop the war when we had a chance. We would have stopped it earlier, but I guess it wasn’t quite ready. But finally we got it ready in time to let ‘em have it, and that’s what stopped the war right there. So I was lucky in that respect. Not only myself, a lot of others. After I got back home from the service, oh, I’ll have to take it back, I have to go back a little bit now. Before I went into the service, that’s how I left, that’s why I left school. Before I left for the service, my mother took sick. And to help out, my sister dropped out of school, she was also, she’s passed away now, she worked at Bates in the office for a while over here. She dropped out to take care of my mother, and I dropped out to go to work to help out. And I never went back."
"AL:","So you were about sixteen then?"
"GB:","I was sixteen when I started to work, but it was a little before my mother got sick and we both stayed home, my sister and I, my older sister, and, to help out the family. And things were doing, going so good for me, making a little money, so it would have been better if I’d have gone back to school, but when you’re young, you know, and making money, I decided that I’d stick with it, so I never went back to school. Then later on, that’s when they sent us at CMVTI to take these management courses. Very helpful, and didn’t cost us nothing. I used to be, at the time they sent me to school I was on the second shift. I was leaving to go to school, on the job, I was leaving to go to school, and then after school I’d come back to finish my shift. It was very nice. I don’t have a thing against Bates Fabrics. It used to be Bates Manufacturing when I first started, then they changed it to Bates Fabrics and (unintelligible word) change. Just like supervisors. Years ago they used to call them second hand. As it went along, then they called, when we started as a supervisor, that’s when they started to call us supervisors, but when they gave us a raise they had to change the title a little bit. So they couldn’t put us as a overseer, but they called us assistant overseer instead of supervisor. 3 But at the end when we, they were starting to let a lot of supervisors go, you know, when the, just before the Chinese people took over the company, they’re the ones that really ruined the place, the Chinamen."
"AL:","The Tang brothers?"
"GB:","Yes, they owned some mills down South also, you know. But they really ruined this place. They were nice to the people, you know, they had their gathering in the summer time for us, you know. But they’re the ones that really, they bought this place for peanuts when they bought it, I think it was $8 million, if I remember right. I can’t really remember, but they bought it for peanuts anyways, at the time. But they were, they were tearing part of Number Five down, which I knew was not right. It finally did caught up with them. They were even tearing down those huge I-beams in the weave room, to hold, to support the heads, jacquard heads. They started (unintelligible phrase) the mill on the canal side, going, tore those beams down. I said, Jesus, you know, that’s (unintelligible phrase). Come to think of it, they were hauling some of that stuff at their mill down South. They stopped them, from what I could see, they had to stop. All of a sudden what they had piled up to go out was left on the floor, on the Main Street upstairs weave room. But they’re the ones that really ruined this place, the beginning of it."
"AL:","That was in the 1980s?"
"GB:","Oh, let’s see, that’s when I got, I really didn’t know I was going to have an interview at the beginning. What I thought was just something like a picture or something they wanted to put in the museum, somebody that’s been here for a while, you know. (Unintelligible phrase)."
"AL:","Can you talk to me about what the difference is between the looms? The jacquard looms and the other looms?"
"GB:","Oh yeah, well, what they had over here in Number One and Two weave was all plain weave. You couldn’t weave nothing too, too fancy, except when they used the dobbies. In Number Five, we had dobbies in Number Five, they moved them up here in Number One and Two. Dobbies, you know, they had a lot of harnesses, you can put up to fourteen harnesses with the dobbies, then you can figure out loom design. Not big designs, small circles or small squares or triangles or, small designs on a dobby, because they’re rigged for plain, and plain weave also. But on a jacquard loom, you can weave real fancy stuff, you know. A big flower design, or you have special tie ups to weave like the Queen Elizabeths and the Martha Washington, the George Washington, the John Adams. Those were, the John Adams, the Queen Elizabeth and some others, I can’t remember, they were weaved, they were very expensive spreads, those bedspreads are very, those were the very expensive spreads, the Queen Elizabeth and the Martha Washington, George Washington, John Adams, all expensive. Like, we still have a George Washington that we’ve had in around 1950. We had given it to my parents, my parents, after my mother passed away, they gave it to us, they gave it back to us. And we’re still using it. They’re very good, they’re very good bedspreads. If you take care of them, they’re very good. See if I can’t go back in between there. A lot of years there."
"AL:","Now, you said your parents worked in the mills?"
"GB:","Yeah, my mother worked in Number Five weave, before I was in the, yeah, she was a battery tender in Number Five weave. 4"
"AL:","And your father?"
"GB:","My father worked at the Libby Mill, he was a (unintelligible word) at the Libby. By the way, I was offered, they don’t know here at Bates, they don’t know this, but I was offered a job at the Libby as a supervisor. And they wanted to see me, my father was telling me, they wanted to see me pretty bad. So I went over, to be sociable, but I had to tell them that I am treated very good across the street, and I don’t have no plans of changing, but, I said, I appreciate your offer and I’ll keep you in mind, I says, you never know what could happen in the future. That’s what I told them."
"AL:","Now, I imagine that your parents spoke French in the home."
"GB:","Oh, they both, oh yeah, we were brought up, I speak French fluently. I have one son, and he lives in Massachusetts, in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and he has a business there with, it has something to do with the fishermen’s association. You know, that’s a fishermen’s town, Gloucester, and I think he has about six employees that work for him over there. And he, and by the way, my son worked for me when I was in One and Two weave, he was a change over man. The people that put, take out the empty warps off the loom and put the full warp, it’s a two man operation. While I was here, he started as an oiler in Number One and Two weave, my son, on, during his summer vacation I’m talking about, I got him up here. And he was up there for a couple years. The second time he came, he was a change over. Paid a little more, so I tried to get him on change over (unintelligible phrase), it was only for, like, you know, vacation time, a couple months. But he was only here twice. He was happy, though, I gave him a check."
"AL:","Now, did your mom and dad still have family in Canada that they went back to visit?"
"GB:","No, I think there was, I have only one, two cousins in Canada that I personally, we personally visit, my wife and I. They’re both girls, they both lost their husbands, and they live in their parents’ house, right there in St. Honore, Quebec. And we’re planning to go again this summer to pay them a visit. They all have big families. This one only had the two girls, it was my mother’s sister. She married a Talbot, and they had two daughters. She had a brother, the others all had big families, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen children, all from big families. She had a brother that lived in St. Hyacinth, they ran a, like a community store. They sold in that store from diaper pins to meat, shoes, clothes, they had everything in that store. It was a country store, they were running a store like that. That family had ten children. And right now, they’re all first cousins, these ten children, they’re all my first cousins. And I wouldn’t know where to reach none of them today. It’s too bad. Two of them were running a shirt factory. They started one in St. Honore, they were employing over two hundred and fifty girls in that factory, shirt factory. Then they opened up another one in St. George, and they’re still running these two factories. They’re quite a little bit out of our class, for one thing, you know, they have the money. He was a barber, besides the store he had a barbershop in there, you know. One of the sons, we’ve seen him about six years ago for the last time. Oh, he had a real nice place, he has a big boat on the lake. He offered us to go (unintelligible phrase), but we wouldn’t bite on that. I don’t want to get involved too, too much. They’re just not our class. There’s another one, you want to know about my parents’ relatives, there’s another one that’s also in St. Honore. She married the oldest, the oldest of the children of that family, they had a lot of, they had over ten children. I never met them all. And the oldest one married into a well-to-do person. He was a contractor, she married a man that was a contractor that built big stuff, like bridges and like a 5 skyscraper or a big job, that kind. So this is another quite high class, too. We went to see them once, they had a, they lived in Montreal, and a beautiful home, you know. (Interruption.)"
"AL:","And so, I have a question. Were there (unintelligible word) or songs, kind of traditions that your family brought over to Maine from Canada?"
"GB:","Very little, very little. As far as I can see today, there was nothing brought from Canada. My grandfather on my father’s side, he was born in, let me see now, I’ve never been to the place. I want to go, but I don’t know if I’ll ever get there. I’m getting up in age, I don’t know. He was born in (name), my father was born in (name), Canada. It must be a, you know, a one-horse town, a small place. And there’s one thing that comes from Canada, from my grandfather’s side, it’s a huge beer, what do you call - ?"
"AL:","A beer pitcher?"
"GB:","A pitcher, a beer picture with a gold trim on top and five glasses that go with it. That comes from my grandfather, so it had to come through Canada. Plus a small cruet, very fancy cruet, it’s only this high, very fancy cruet. My grandfather died in 1945 while I was in the service. I was able to come to the funeral. I was stationed at the time at Geiger Field in Spokane, Washington, so I had a, being in the Air Force, I was able to get a priority to come home. But I’m sorry I took the priority, I could have got home just as fast on the train, because we hopped in four or five different places before they dropped, the closest I could get to home was New Jersey. I had to take a bus from there to here. I missed the funeral. So I was home for a few days and went back."
"AL:","So were there any meals that your mother made that she learned in -?"
"GB:","Oh, my mother was a great cook."
"AL:","What kind of things?"
"GB:","Well, like meat pie for one thing, it’s popular in Canada, right? And I can’t, I can’t mention you what she cooked, you know, but a really good cook. And I married, the woman I married was a Fin, is Finnish. She speaks Finnish fluently like I speak French fluently. She writes Finnish, and I can write French. But in between my mother’s cooking, and my wife’s a great cook. My wife has three sisters and they’re all great cooks in the family. She still makes, follows her mother’s recipe, she makes bread almost, every other day or every three days she’s making bread. She made some yesterday for the company we’re having today, homemade bread. Very, very good. And the funny part about it, all these years I was going, I was married to, still married, they manage, her parents made a cake, they called it pico cakie, right? So when I first had some pico cakie, I says you know something, I says, I don’t know if your mother got this recipe from Finland or what, but I says, my mother makes the same cake and she’s been making this cake since I was a child growing up. But I said, we never called a pico cakie, but it’s the same thing, must be the same recipe, I said, tastes the same, exactly the same, it looks the same, tastes the same. It was funny, we talk about it, you know."
"AL:","I have a question. You were growing up in Lewiston during the Depression years, 1930s."
"GB:","Right, right."
"AL:","In what ways did you experience the Depression? 6"
"GB:","The Depression, I can’t really remember much about the Depression, but I know my father had, they had a hard time during the Depression. He was working two jobs, my father was working two jobs during the Depression. And the kids were all small then, so my mother was home, she was a homemaker. She went to work only after we were grown up. She didn’t go too long in the mills, she just went, I guess probably to get out of the house, or -. But during the Depression, I can remember my father worked two jobs, I know that. And besides his (unintelligible word) job he had another job, I can’t remember, I think he was helping for a subcontractor for the city. It wasn’t involved with, directly with the city, I think it was a subcontractor, and at that time they were putting sewers, if I remember right now, they were putting sewers not far from where we lived on Donald Street. They were putting sewers on Sabattus Street at Thorn’s Corner. They were digging, a lot of digging and they had to do some blas-, (unintelligible phrase) around the Holy Family Church, they were digging. They had to dig quite deep, was a ledge there, they’d do some blasting, and he was working for a company where they were doing blasting and using jack hammers, you know, that was his second job for a while. But I know they had a, they had a, they would have had problems otherwise. But they were, we traded at the time, we bought our groceries at a store at the corner of Randall Road and Sabattus Street, there was a store there that ran, was ran by a Beaulieu. We know the family well. And they took care of us good over there, we could buy let’s say for two, three weeks at a time, we wouldn’t have to pay. Just when my father was able to dump some money, so that helped him during the Depression, you know, it helped the family out."
"AL:","Did you ever get involved in the sports that the mill sponsored?"
"GB:","I never did, no, not at the mill. It’s odd, because I love hockey. At Holy Family, I went to school there, they started a hockey team while I was there and I played two years on the team. But it didn’t last, they didn’t have a coach at Holy Family. That’s another funny story. We had a hockey team over there, and the coach was from St. Peter and Paul’s, it was a brother from St. Peter and Paul’s was coaching the hockey team at Holy Family. So we had a big kick when we came down, we used to play on Bartlett Street, there used to be a, they called it the tin can, it was, the building was all corrugated tin, you know, the wall was cold. Wasn’t (unintelligible phrase) like they have today. We used to come down there. You know where St. Dom’s High School used to be, on Bartlett Street? Well, it was right next to that, the skating rink. But when we come to play the same level as us from St. Dom’s, it was a coach from St. Peter’s, and he really, really wanted us to beat them, too. And my position was center, I was a fast skater, and I wasn’t big, I wasn’t on defense. You could go, you’d get checked just the same, but I wasn’t on defense, I was a center ice (unintelligible phrase). I enjoyed it very much. In fact, I have season’s ticket for the Maniacs. I’ve had them since they started, three years in a row now. But I won’t be getting them next season. They don’t know yet, but I’ll have to tell them when they call me. They let you know, if you want to keep your seat. I’ll have to tell them that I’ll have to drop it, because it happens too many times where there’s people come up the house and I can’t be there. I like the hockey and I got the tickets, so I go to the hockey game. And so I’m going, that’s one reason, and then my health. I have a bad right hip. I might have to get a hip replacement, I don’t know, that’s immaterial. But anyways, I have a, you got to do a lot of climbing, you know, to get your seat. I got a nice seat, too, center ice. I wouldn’t take a seat otherwise, I had to be in center ice. I got both ends, you know, you see the both ends good, right underneath the press box, that’s center ice."
"AL:","Are there things that I haven’t asked you about the mill that you feel is important to add? 7"
"GB:","Well, let’s see. Well as far as the mill, like I say, I don’t have nothing against Bates. They treated me very well. The only thing I had, ever had, was with that one overseer that wouldn’t let me get on to, but that turned out to be all right, they finally asked me to be a supervisor, and I refused, the first time they asked me I didn’t take it, I refused. My wife told me, you can do it, you should have taken it, try it, you know. So I refused anyways. It took a little while longer, they came back again, so I thought I’d give it a try. And I was on it all the time, all the, until I retired. After I retired they did call me three times to do some weaving and teaching. I was also running, teaching weavers while I was weaving. And as a supervisor I was, they were starting a school over here in the, part of a, out where they used to have the card room, what’s next to the weave room on that end. There was a section that was empty there, they were going to start a school. And I guess it didn’t work out, and I don’t know why, I never did get to teach in that area. I was using an office to teach, not too far from here, upstairs, I’d have to go upstairs to show you. They gave me a room, I had up to fourteen persons one time. But it’s a funny thing, one person amongst all of them, one of them was always hitting me with a lot of questions. I could tell that he knew a little bit about the looms. He was from Edward’s in Augusta. And so I told them, I said, I’ve got a guy up there, I says, he’s not giving me any problems but he seems to know quite a bit, I says, I’d like to know some of his background. So they got rid of him, Bates, when they found out who he was. He was from, that’s what I found out, he was from Edward’s, and he was an instigator and he had been fired from over there. He was an instigator, so I got rid of that one. Funny, you know. Another one, a student, was a girl. It’s too bad, she got caught embezzling money at the Holy Family Credit Union and she lost her job. A lot of things happened while I was at Bates. We had one, I won’t mention any name, but we had one that worked for the credit union at Bates, when it was the Federal Credit Union at Bates, I had, I was on their committee for twenty-four years, on the credit union at Bates. There was a guy that was the president at the time, I won’t mention his name, he lost his job, shoplifting. And sometimes it’s a disease, you know, it’s not that that’s the way, it’s a disease. And then there was another one, maybe you know some of these people, the paymaster at Bates, he was a paymaster, he got caught for sexual harassment with a young girl. Not in town here, he lived out of town. And he had to go to jail at the time, you know, he lost his job at the time. You know, you never know, you see these people you work with, and these things happen, it’s shocking, you know."
"AL:","Were there ever strikes at the mill?"
"GB:","Well, I’ve never seen any incidents except one with me, as a supervisor in Number One and Two weave. I was on the third, I used to, they used to bounce me up around on second shift, third shift, second shift, third shift. I was on the third shift at the time, a cloth doffer are the people that take the cloth off the loom, the rolls off the loom. We were hiring a cloth doffer, I had to use some other help to work with the cloth doffer, so up until they hired a man, they did, they finally got a man, he was from Bates College, I didn’t know that, but he was from Bates College, to come in on the third shift. So I’m sitting in the office over there, and a quarter of eleven, nobody. Ten of eleven, nobody. We started at eleven, you know? Eleven o’clock, nobody. He never showed up. Because the bosses had told me there was supposed to be a so-and-so come in, and never showed up. So I went into my routine, check the two rooms, One and Two weave, make sure everybody is in and everything, and everybody’s on their job or whatever. It takes fifteen minutes, half an hour. When I’m done doing that, and that’s the first thing I do in the mornings, and I go back in the office to do some paperwork and whatever. 8 When I came back, see, there wasn’t too many people on the third shift, so when I came back this guy is in the office, sitting on my desk, you know. His boots, he took off his boots, had them on the floor, and sitting on my desk. So I went, he was sitting, it’s a double desk, you know, the overseer sat on that side and I had my, over here, it was a big desk. He was sitting on the corner, and the door’s right there, he was sitting on that corner of the desk, like he was over here. And I had a big computer right here, you know, the old type, key type. And I was sitting there, I have a telephone next to me there, he was sitting on my -, so I came and I sat down, I looked at my paper, I says, you must be so-and-so. He says, yeah. I got up, I introduced myself. He was under, he was intoxicated. Yeah. I could smell it on him, too. So I told him, I says, you know, I says, I can’t put you to work today, but I’m going to give you a break. I says, you come back tomorrow night, sober, fit to work, and I’ll give you a job. But, I said, I can’t put you on a job tonight, you can’t go to work, I says, it’s dangerous for you and for the people you’re working with, and so I cannot put you to -. He got mad, he got mad, he got up, and he gave me a shove. My telephone landed on the floor. The computer almost went on the floor. It was heavy, too, but it didn’t, you know, it came off but it didn’t fall. My chair tipped over, and there was a radiator on this wall here, and I landed and I hit my head on the radiator, but I didn’t really hurt, but I was lucky. But I was hoping I would see someone through the window, there was windows in that office, to call, you know, so I won’t be alone with him, because I finally got up. But he didn’t hassle me any more after I got up. But I did finally get in touch with the, shop steward happened to go by and I motioned to him to come in. Well, he stepped in the door and I told him, I says, I’m having a problem, I want you to call a guard right now. So he did. They finally came over and they took him out. He didn’t want to leave. He said he (unintelligible phrase) period. And I, hey, I can’t put you out. So finally they got him out. The next day I went, the first thing I did, I head for the personnel office, I told them about the incident, and I told them that I didn’t want to see the guy again, period. The way he acted towards me, I said, I don’t want him up there. They never bothered with, they didn’t rehire him or anything, they got rid of him. That’s the only thing I ever had as a supervisor. I was a little worried that nobody’s going to show up, you know, who knows what’s going to happen. And I was told by the, let’s see, it was Steve Crowley at the time, I think he was, Steve Crowley’s the one that put, that asked me to be a supervisor. Do you know Steve Crowley? You don’t know Steve Crowley."
"AL:","I know the name."
"GB:","You know the name, yeah. Well, he’s the one that asked me and another guy on the job, we both went in as supervisors together. The other person was Stanley Judd, he was the other person. We both got on at the same time. So Crowley told me personally that he was very glad that I never touched that person. I could have poked him in between the eyes so easy, you know, but I never touched him. I was able to handle the thing without touching him, you know."
"AL:","Is there anything else that we should add, or do you feel like you’ve given me what you know?"
"GB:","There might be things, well, you know, we’ve had nice times at Bates, they used to, they had a big time at the Armory when they had the, (unintelligible word) a Frenchman came to this."
"AL:","Maurice Chevalier."
"GB:","Maurice Chevalier, oh, it was beautiful, they had a beautiful evening for us over there."
"AL:","And Bates paid for that? 9"
"GB:","Oh yeah, Bates paid for that, right, right."
"AL:","And did you ever go to the picnics, they had picnics in the summer."
"GB:","Oh, they used to have picnics at the Montagnard, on the pond, No Name Pond. And, oh, they used to have a lot of good times earlier, it cost money. We used to go at the, in Poland there, at the summer resort in Poland."
"AL:","Oh, Poland Spring House?"
"GB:","Poland Spring there, Poland Spring House, they used to have nice times over there, yeah."
"AL:","And was that in like the ‘50s?"
"GB:","It’s hard for me to give you a date. I’d hate to give you a date that wouldn’t be right, you know."
"AL:","Well, I guess what I’m asking is, in the later years, did things stop, did the events stop happening?"
"GB:","Oh, they finally stopped, I guess because of the money maybe, you know. It must have cost money to have those banquets, they had hundreds of people go over there, and they gave watches for the ones that were retiring at fifty years, and they were giving ten year pins, and twenty five year pins, you know. So, I’ve got a ten-year pin, twenty-five-year pin, but I never got a watch. (Unintelligible phrase) enough to get a watch."
"AL:","Were you there, what, forty-eight years?"
"GB:","Forty-eight years, a long time, a lifetime, yeah."
"AL:","Thank you very much."
"GB:","Oh, you’re welcome."
