"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) May 23, 2006 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Mill Workers Oral History Project. The date is May 23rd, 2006, and this is Andrea L’Hommedieu, and today I’m at the mill conference room with Gerry Letourneau. And Gerry, could you start just by saying your full name? Germain Letourneau: Germain Mario Letourneau."
"AL:","And when were your born?"
"GL:","I was born in East Albany, Vermont."
"AL:","And the date?"
"GL:","9/14/31"
"AL:","And did you grow up in Vermont?"
"GL:","No, I lived in Vermont about six years, then we came to Lewiston."
"AL:","And what were your parents’ names?"
"GL:","Letourneau, (name) and Eugene."
"AL:","And what did they do for work when you were growing up?"
"GL:","My mother was a housekeeper, my dad worked at the Androscoggin Mill."
"AL:","So your father had worked at the Androscoggin Mill, and what did he do there?"
"GL:","He was a cleaner, loom cleaner. When he left there, he went into mechanics, on automobiles, for more money."
"AL:","And so when you moved to Lewiston, what part of Lewiston did you live in? 1"
"GL:","One hundred and eight Knox. The building is gone now, right on the corner of Knox and, I guess it’s called Locust Street or, I’m not sure."
"AL:","So you were fairly near the mill."
"GL:","Very near, very near."
"AL:","And were there lots of families living in that area, when you did?"
"GL:","Oh yes, all French families, some, a few Polish people. But they all worked in the mill. In fact, the people upstairs on the fourth floor, their name was Poisson, and come to find out years later, Poisson was working for me at the Hill Mill. He was part of the family."
"AL:","And there were a lot bigger families then, weren’t there?"
"GL:","Oh yeah, much bigger. My family, we were twelve."
"AL:","Twelve, ten kids and the parents, or twelve kids?"
"GL:","Oh no, twelve kids. Twelve kids. I had eight sisters and three brothers."
"AL:","And where did you fall in the line of the children."
"GL:","I was the first boy in the family, after six girls. I was spoiled."
"AL:","What was it like growing up in such a big family?"
"GL:","Well, it was difficult at times, and we always had enough to eat and a place to sleep, nice and warm, we went to school at St. Peter’s School. I graduated from St. Peter’s School in 1945, then I went to St. Dom’s for two years, and then I gave up going to school, I was working."
"AL:","Was your first job in the mill?"
"GL:","Oh, no, I worked as a dishwasher. I don’t know if you remember Tanguay’s Drug & Sundry on the corner of Blake and Sabattus, was owned by Raymond and Rosaire Boulet. They had a candy shop. I’d stop in there and wash pots and pans when I was in the seventh and eighth grade. From there I got a job three hours a day at Jimmy’s Diner. That’s where I began my cooking career, so-called, and I stayed there for a long while. And like I said, Ray (name), which is a friend of Rachel, he went to work for Friend’s Restaurant on Walnut Street, and they were doing catering, banquets and stuff 2 like that, and while I was still working at Jimmy’s, in fact I was the youngest cook ever at Jimmy’s, I was seventeen years old, I was running the second shift. Ray called me, he said, Gerry, come on down here, Mrs. Nadeau will pay you more money and you can work with me, so I went there. Now, I’m seventeen, and when I got to be eighteen I wanted to go in the mill because that’s where the money was. I had three sisters that worked at the Hill Mill. Well, they finally got me in. I started at the Hill Mill in November of 1949."
"AL:","At that time did you, was it important that you knew somebody already working in the mill?"
"GL:","It helped, it helped. It helped. It’s always a little chiseling there, you know."
"AL:","And what did your sisters do in the mill?"
"GL:","They were spooler tenders. Mary was a spinner, (name) and Yvette were spooler tenders. And Marybelle wasn’t there yet, she came after me."
"AL:","And so, what was your first job in the mill?"
"GL:","I was a general hand. In other words, you were, replaced someone if someone was out on a mediocre job. Lowest paid thing there was. I can’t remember what, I think I was getting sixty-eight cents an hour. It was a lot of money, gee."
"AL:","So how long did you work that position?"
"GL:","Oh, maybe three or four months. Then I went, I got a job, because you had to bid for jobs, they were union, partial union at the time. And I got yarn man, then I went as a beam doffer in the warpers, I learned how to run the warpers. But I was always very nosy, and I learned a lot more. I learned how to spool, I learned how to twist, I learned how to, you name it, I was into everything, best I could. And that’s how I became the supervisor. My overseer, which was Ovide Charest, his son is still alive, lives on the Hotel Road, he was more or less the man that brought me up. So I became a supervisor in 1956. I was a second hand on the third shift. That was the beginning of my textile career."
"AL:","And so talk about the years that you were supervisor, and the different mills. You worked at three different mills over your career, right?"
"GL:","Yes, well, let me try, I’ll go over that kind of quickly to start with here. I stayed at the Hill Mill because I, they were just in the process there of changing all the machines, they were bringing in new machines all the time. New looms, new spinning frames, new 3 winders, new twisters, they were spending an awful lot of money, in the carding department, everywhere in the Hill Mill, and things were really progressing. So they needed people on top as bad as they needed people in the bottom. But it got kind of hectic. I stuck around until 1961, I got into an argument with the plant manager. I insisted that I got more money, because I was doing more. And he didn’t want to give it to me, so I gave him my notice. And the last day I worked, which was on a Saturday, they came to me and they offered me more money, and I said, no, I wasn’t worth it two weeks ago, I’m not worth it now. Because I already had a job. So I went and did something stupid. I thought I could sell cars, so I sold automobiles for four years. And I did very good, made more money than I made in the mill. But it wasn’t for me. It was making me slide the other way. I was dying to get back in the mill. So they were hard up for help, they were making material for the Korean War there, the material for the Navy, and they needed help, they were running on Saturdays and Sundays. So I went to work, working Saturdays and Sundays after I got out of work from my job at selling cars. I did that for about four weeks and I decided, they told me, they says, you want to come back as a supervisor, we’ll hire you right now. So I came back. Then I stayed there til it closed in 1971."
"AL:","And then you went to the Bates Mill?"
"GL:","Then I came here to the Bates Mill. Of course, there was a lot of politics at the top, everybody’s looking for a job, the mill was closing. And they had told me and two or three others, we’re going to bring you to Bates and you’re going to be going here, you’re going to be going there, and you’re going there. That didn’t happen. I ended up running the fringe department, which I knew nothing about. But I learned awful fast. And to top it off, my nephew was the supervisor of the fringe department. Well, he got scared with me being here, thought I was going to take his job, he quits. So he leaves me stuck with that department, and I didn’t know nothing about it. But I managed. Anyway, that was the beginning. So I did that for about two years, a little over two years, and I says, all the policies were bad, and I couldn’t stand the union president, I hate his guts. We just didn’t get along. So I went to Libby Mill and I asked them for a job. I got it. Good job. Two days before I was to report to work, the place burnt down. You remember that?"
"AL:","I don’t remember it, no."
"GL:","My job burnt down. And so here I am without a job. But, the plant manager at Hill Mill, which was John Sherry, was politically moved to Augusta. But what I didn’t know was Augusta was being sold to Mr. Miller. So John Sherry went to Augusta, he called me up, he says, Gerry, you got a job? I says, no, he says, well come on up here, 4 you start Monday morning. I says, doing what? He says, what you were doing at the Hill. Okay. I went. So in the meantime, Miller bought the place. So we thought again I’d be looking for a job, but Mr. Miller insisted that I stay, and I worked there four and a half years. And those are good people up there, good people, I got along good with them."
"AL:","And then you came back to Bates?"
"GL:","And I came, I gave up there because I was getting sick and tired of the ride, every day it was forty-five miles. I lived out in Minot, so my father got me something down here. Rudy Poliquin, which was the superintendent here, said, Gerry, come on back, he said, I’ll give you a job, night superintendent. You control the whole mill, that’s how come I know so much about it. So I did that for about four years, and I took over the spinning department, and I took over the winding, the slashing, I worked just about everywhere. And then I quit here, I guess that was about October, 1992, I retired."
"AL:","Can you talk about, I don’t have a lot of descriptions of the slashing department. Can you talk about what that department did?"
"GL:","Well, that’s putting the cart ahead of the horse, here."
"AL:","Okay, do you want to start -?"
"GL:","Because if you look at a slasher, a slasher is the last step in putting the yarn in position for weaving. That’s the last step. The beginning is way, way back."
"AL:","Okay, let’s start at the beginning."
"GL:","Oh, my goodness. Well, in the beginning you have, which was above this office right there, two or three gentlemen, which were cotton buyers. Classifiers, they knew cotton. And that cotton was purchased and brought here. When it got here, these gentlemen had it all classified. It would come to the opening, that is the beginning. That is where the yarn strength, the color, cleanliness is all decided. They lay down bales and they mix this cotton. It goes through steel aprons and beaters and begins the cleaning process. Now from the opening room, and the cleaners and all the beaters and everything else, it goes to what is called a card. A card is two cylinders, wire cylinders. They bring in the stock and they start laying the stock parallel, and they make what they call sliver. Now, the cotton, instead of being in balls, it’s in a long strand, it begins to lay it parallel. After it leaves the card, it goes to drawing frames. Eight or ten of these ends that come from the cards are put in these drawing frames, and they go through a bunch of rolls, and the rolls draft it out some more into a smaller and more condensed, and more 5 parallel yarn, like cotton. From the draw frames, after it (unintelligible word) in the form of sliver again, it goes to what is called a slubber. A slubber makes roving. It takes one of these (unintelligible word), picks that one (unintelligible phrase) rolls to bring it down to a size. It’s either 70-hank, 90-hank, 60-hank size of the rolling. From there it goes to what is called spinning, the spinning frame. Now, a spinning frame takes the roving, they run it through (unintelligible word) rolls, that one strand, now the strand becomes very fine, becomes thread. (Unintelligible word) on the ring, which is round, on that ring there is a little metal, piece of metal that is called a traveler. The end is put in that traveler and wrapped around the bobbin in the center, that when the frame is running, the speed of that spindle, which is turning the bobbin and winding the yarn, is putting twist in the yarn, and that’s giving it strength. And that little traveler is traveling over a mile a minute. It’s really something to see if you’ve never seen it. And after that bobbin is full, it goes to what is called a winding machine. It could be a spooler, could be a coating machine, depending what the outlook is going to be. And now (unintelligible phrase) a bunch of cheeses, it’s called a cheese. From the cheese it went to a warper. All these cheeses were predominantly all the same weight. Same, there was maybe four or five miles of yarn on each package. Brought to the warper, a certain number was creeled into a creel, it comes to the front of the warper, it’s fed in through a comb. That’s the first step at laying the yarn in position for weaving. Now they, let’s say that the (unintelligible word) you’re looking for is going to require, oh, five thousand ends. So you go to each section beams of so many ends, probably ten or twelve, whatever you want your yardage to be, and then you put that behind the slasher. Now you got ten of these beams with, let’s say, five hundred ends on each one of them, that goes in the slasher. The slasher has what they call sizing capacity, it has starch or chemical of some sort to coat the yarn to give it strength. And it goes through these side boxes, gets pressed out, dried on cylinders, onto a warp. The warp is the last step, ready to go onto a loom."
"AL:","And then it’s ready."
"GL:","It’s ready to weave. Ready to weave. And when they bring it to the loom, they tie it in or draw it in, whatever, and they make cloth with that yarn. But at the Hill it was a little different. Because, see, this was a carding mill. Hill Mill was a combed cotton mill. There they had, after it left the card (unintelligible word), they have combers that would comb that yarn until it was beautiful, clean, no little black dots, nothing to see in 6 the cotton. Beautiful. I got some material that we made at the Hill in my truck right now. The disciplined fabric, you ever heard of it?"
"AL:","Yes."
"GL:","That famous disciplined fabric style. (Unintelligible phrase) a piece of it right in my truck. I kept it all these years. That’s about the story in how yarn begins."
"AL:","I’m thinking of maybe some people you worked with that have passed away, that I can’t interview, that you could talk to me about or describe. Is there anyone you remember working with that were memorable?"
"GL:","Quite a few people. Like, you interviewed Aime Foisy, Joe Foisy’s his brother. Was overseer of the weave room when I was overseer upstairs, in the (unintelligible word) room. Very good man. I’m surprised Aime didn’t bring him up. Like I said, Ovide Charest, my teacher. And there was Paul Emory, he was, had a lot to do with my decision of staying in textile, really."
"AL:","Did you work with Fred Lebel a lot?"
"GL:","Oh yeah, I worked with Fred years and years. Fred used to take time studies of my machines. He was a, he worked with the engineering department, when I was supervisor, (unintelligible phrase). Ray Croteau is still alive."
"AL:","I interviewed him, yup."
"GL:","Ray came off the police force, came to work at the Hill Mill for me as a yarn man. The guy was very intelligent, you know, and I see how smart he was, and (unintelligible phrase) Ovide Charest says to me, he said, they’re looking for nominees for industrial engineering department, he says, you got anybody on your shift? I says, yeah, but he’s a damn smart man, used to be a cop, Ray Croteau. So I put his name in. They took him. That’s how he got his career, began his career in engineering. Oh, Ray has been a friend of mine for a long, long time. Larry Coltrap in engineering, Ronny Gosselin, that’s Fred’s son-in-law. Oh yeah, I worked for Fred a long time; with Fred and for Fred."
"AL:","Now, the years that you were working at the mill, did the mill have activities that you got involved in? I know there was bowling, and at one time there was hockey."
"GL:","I never really participated in any of that. I did follow the hockey team, though, when the hockey team was playing. They were, that was, I really liked that, I really went for that. But the rest of, the bowling and all that stuff, I never got involved with that."
"AL:","Now, did you get involved much with the union? As a supervisor? 7"
"GL:","The union was a good thing to happen here, because I helped organize a strike in 1951. I was secretary of the joint board for the union. There were things going on that I didn’t particularly think were honest, that was my opinion. So when I became a supervisor, fighting the union was, but I didn’t mind that, I loved it. I used to, oh, I, they had a contract and I made damn sure they did what they were supposed to do, that was their job. But most people were very good about that. But you did have a few that, I, for instance I had one guy, I won’t mention his name, he had a box in the middle of the alley where he traveled, and he’d walk over the box. Now I asked him once (unintelligible word) in fact, the shop steward was with me. I says, I want you to see something. And when he came back, he walked over the box. I said, Bob, why don’t you move that box? It’s not my job. That’s the part that really bugged me. And that’s exactly, when that phrase started becoming popular amongst union, and it’s still being used today, I thought, my God, I got a Bath Iron Works here. They lay off electricians, and they hire welders. Lay off carpenters, they hire this guy. Because nobody, that’s not my job. They won’t learn the other guy’s trade. So that’s part of the problem with unions today."
"AL:","Now, the strike in 1951, do you remember what the strike was about?"
"GL:","Money."
"AL:","Wages?"
"GL:","Wages, and vacation pay. And insurance. Which are all things we really needed. That was affordable, I was all for that."
"AL:","How long was that strike?"
"GL:","It lasted about a month."
"AL:","And did most of the employees participate?"
"GL:","Oh, yes. In fact, it was damn near a hundred percent. But after three weeks, got very itchy, they were ready to come back. Keeping them out was a big thing, but they did."
"AL:","It must have been difficult for weekly wage earners to go that long with those big families."
"GL:","Oh yes, oh yeah, you depended on your pay every Friday. It wasn’t there. Of course the union would say they would help, but I mean you probably got ten or fifteen dollars. What the hell was that? But anyway, we did win and it came out all right. 8"
"AL:","Are there any particular incidents or memories that you have of your time working in the mill that I haven’t asked you about, that you think would be -?"
"GL:","I think it was a good experience. It helped me develop my character, more or less, and helped me, you learned an awful lot about people. So much, and so many different kind of people. Lots of Polish, Irish, English, French, a lot of French. I was French. French always paid off. Because one time, we were buying yarn here from Egypt, and I got a bad shipment. So I got hold of Fred and I told Fred, I says, hey, you can’t let these guys get away with this, that’s a lot of pounds in this bag. It’s okay, we’ll get ‘em in here. Well, they sent their brokers or whoever they were from Egypt or Thailand or whatever it was, and he came to the mill here, my office, not far from where Rachel is here. And they had an interpreter and everything so we could discuss, the yarns all laid out, and we were discussing the yarns through the interpreter. At that moment my supervisor, which was Lucien Poisson, the guy I told you about that lived on Knox Street, came in with a girl, and she had a problem and she spoke to me in French. The Egyptian looks at me, he says, “Vous parlez Francais?” We didn’t need the interpreter any more. He spoke French, so did I, so we got along from there. So you never can tell, know when your French came in handy. (Unintelligible phrase) and were fascinating, you know. Especially the new machines, when they came to the Hill there. When they closed the place, that’s the place you had the newest machines. They moved everything to Augusta. Some came here. It was quite an operation."
"AL:","Do you remember sort of the change in ownership of the mills over the years?"
"GL:","Now, that happened so many times, you get so you get a little mixed up about it."
"AL:","Do you remember the Tang brothers?"
"GL:","Oh, do I. Those guys were a disaster, they were here to clean it out. They didn’t like me. (Unintelligible phrase) they were going to fire me. They did. Three days later they called me back. And they didn’t want me to go on the payroll, they wanted me to be a consultant. I says, “One thousand dollars a week.” He says, “We can’t afford to pay that.” And I says, “Well I ain’t coming.” They paid it. Plus all my expenses that I had, they had me traveling from here to Fall River setting up some machines over there for them. So about eight months, like Fred says, you’re really making it Gerry. I said, yeah, why not? The bastards screwed me, it’s my turn. So that’s what I did. I was happy to see them go, although what’s going on the mill right now is what they wanted to do. They had the original master plan of making this a pavilion and do shops and restaurants, and. I’m glad they sold the mill. City of Lewiston would 9 probably have it. They had (unintelligible phrase) like all drawn out and everything. They were smart Chinks, I’ll tell you, very smart. I guess they still own the mill in South Carolina. I went there three or four times. Minette Mills."
"AL:","Well great, thank you very much for your time."
"GL:","Not a problem, been glad to do it."
