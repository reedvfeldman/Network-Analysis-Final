"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) April 2, 2008 Andrea L'Hommedieu : This is an interview for the Shoe Workers Oral History Project at the Museum L-A. The date is April 2nd , 2008 . I'm at the home of Rolande and Norm LeClair in Lewiston , Maine, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu . First, I'd like to just have you say your name, your full name, and spell it for me. Rolande LeClair: Rolande LeClair, R-0-L-A-N-0-E capital L-E capital C-L-A-1-R."
"AL:","And Norm, could you give me your full name? Normand LeClair: Oh, absolutely. Normand J. LeClair, N-0-R-M-A-N-0, that's French, J for Joseph, LeClair, L-E capital C-L-A-1-R."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"RL:","In Lewiston, in 1932."
"AL:","And did you grow up in Lewiston?"
"RL:","Yes, I did."
"AL:","What area of Lewiston?"
"RL:","Lincoln Street, that I remember way back when."
"AL:","And were your parents from Maine?"
"RL:","My mother was from Canada , and my dad was from Lewiston."
"AL:","And so were you a big family?"
"RL:","A family of seventeen living."
"AL:","Wow, that's a lot, and where did you fall within those siblings?"
"RL:","I was the firstborn ."
"AL:","Okay, do you still have lots of brothers and sisters in the area ."
"RL:","There's sixteen of us still here. We only lost one."
"AL:","Wow, what was it like growing up in such a big family? I come from a family of one brother, and so for me it's quite an experience to hear about this."
"RL:","Well, it was hard times, but being the eldest one, my mother stopped having children at forty six, so I stopped having children and she kept having children, so it's really strange."
"AL:","Right, wow, did you do a lot of family oriented things, because of the large family, in terms of social activities and -?"
"RL:","Well, we mainly did it amongst ourselves, you know, the family itself, no outsiders."
"AL:","And Norm, where did you grow up?"
"NL:","I grew up in Lewiston, born 1935, March 14th, goes way back. I, contrary to my wife, come from a very small family. I have one sister that's seventeen years younger than I am, and basically that's about as far as kinfolks, and born and raised here in Lewiston and proud of it."
"AL:","And what did your parents do for work? Were they from Lewiston?"
"NL:","Yes, they were both from Lewiston, and oddly enough back then, if your parents worked in a shoe shop, the odds were that you were going to work in a shoe shop, or in some cases it would be the mill. In my case it was a shoe factory, so consequently I went to high school and during high school I ended working at the shoe factory on a part time basis until I graduated. I worked in the factory after that for about seventeen years."
"AL:","Now, Rolande, when did you begin in the shoe factories? Was this before you married?"
"RL:","I was sixteen, I quit school to go work. Being the eldest, I had to go help, so, and then I got married at twenty-two, that's when I stopped working in a factory and I stayed home. I had a child then, so."
"AL:","Right, so for about six years, worked. Which shoe factory did you work in?"
"NL:","Wood & Smith, wasn 't it?"
"RL:","Before that it was -?"
"NL:","(Name) , no."
"RL:","It was Lewiston , where Knapp Shoe founded , no, oh yes, I can't remember the name of the first one, but then I went to Wood , Wood & Smith, and I worked there for three or four years , and that's when I got married ."
"NL:","Raised three kids."
"AL:","So you were allowed to work at sixteen , or how did it-?"
"RL:","Oh yes, yeah , as long as you had your permit they allowed you to work, so that's when I started working."
"AL:","And so what sort of jobs did you do at that time?"
"RL:","I started stitching right off, and then I went on to doing fancy stitching."
"AL:","And was any of that piecework?"
"RL:","At first it was hourly work. When I went to work at Wood & Smith, it was piece-."
"AL:","Piecework, yes?"
"RL:","What do you call it? Yeah, piecework."
"AL:","Were you get paid by how much you get done."
"RL:","Right, right, and I made more money then than some of the kids of today, and that's fifty years ago. I said , I can 't believe that. Yeah , so they used to pay quite a bit then compared to now, so."
"AL:","And tell me about when you first entered the shoe factory."
"NL:","Oh, okay, that was a factory called Bel Moe, and down on Lincoln Street, and what they did, they made a loafer, which if you , well I don't know if you 'd remember, you're too young , but with the loafer, what the kids, at one point they used to put a dime in the strap in the front of the shoe. I guess that the loafer, there was no straps or buckles to this, so consequently kids used to put a dime because, in case they needed to call home, I imagine. It's kind of cute. In any event, I stayed for about three years, and I did shipping and receiving there. I worked for a wonderful gentleman by the name of Fred Gavin. Then we got married and , well no, we were contemplating getting married . So, the wages weren't much back then if you're on , if you weren't on piecework. As I recall , I was making forty-five cents an hour, and they gave me a raise. Here's a cute ditty, they gave me a raise of a nickel, which I was pretty upset, so my foreman says, that isn't fair, I'll get you a better raise than that. So he came and he did , he got me a dime raise. True story. So that lasted for a little while, then I had the opportunity to go to Clark Shoe. Now, Clark Shoe was located in Auburn, they employed somewhere, oh, maybe five hundred people at the time, and what they were making then was a very fancy woman 's shoe. When I'm talking about fancy shoes, I'm talking about the shoes with the high heels, the pointed toes, and a big variety of women 's shoes, and they were sold from coast to coast. And I was, I started there as a cutter. I don't know if you're familiar with that or not. I didn't do the upper, cut the upper part of the shoe, but I used to cut the linings that went into that shoe. Because back then, there was no such thing as synthetic materials. Everything was done from leather, including the inner sole, the outer sole, the vamps, everything was complete, hundred percent leather shoe. And back then they sold for, I can't remember what they sold them for at the time, but it was a high priced shoe. So after working on the line for something, oh, I don't know, maybe six, seven years, I had the opportunity to get off the line and to go work on a, basically right on a piecework, it was an hourly wage, it was, they needed somebody as an expediter. Now, what that was, they had decided besides the fancy shoe that they were making at one factory, they opened up another factory that was making a lower line shoe. By then, synthetics started coming in and so now they'd compete with the foreign countries, so they needed somebody to determine when the leather and the (unintelligible) would come, to which department it would go to. So I basically started doing that, and I was very fortunate that they decided to send me to school, so I went to, trying to think now, well, it's a trade in Auburn, CMVTI. I'm sorry, it's an age thing, so-."
"RL:","It's a different name now, Central Maine Community College now."
"NL:","So consequently, after taking a few courses on management and such , I ended up working in the office, and I eventually became a purchasing agent, which was for all the findings . When I'm talking findings, I'm, we're looking at the counters that go into the shoe, the ornaments, being a fancy shoe, they had all kinds of ornaments that they put on these shoes, all except the leather, because that was a purchasing area by itself. And I did that until the day they decided they were going to close the factory. And at one time, we were doing very well. To give you an idea, throughout the year, it was something like, they were getting something like maybe five thousand pairs of shoes a day out of the factory, and during the busy season, like spring line and the fall line, they probably would have as much as maybe ten, twelve thousand pairs of shoes that went out of that factory. So it was quite interesting. I felt kind of sad when they decided to close the factory , but that's basically what's been happening since the '60s, late '70s."
"AL:","Was it back in the '80s when they closed, or no?"
"NL:","No, it was -."
"RL:","Before that."
"NL:","It was before that, late '60s, early '70s, I believe, yeah, because 1-."
"RL:","Because Karen was born in '61 ."
"NL:","Yeah, (unintelligible)."
"RL:","Were you working for (name) then?"
"NL:","Yeah, if we go back thirty-five years from now, what are we looking at? The '70s, right? So yeah, because after that in order to stay in Lewiston, I went out of the shoe business and went in as a lumber salesman. Quite a switch."
"AL:","Did you, when you were at the shoe shop and knew that it, did you have a sense that it was going, declining, and that you were going to be out of a job?"
"NL:","Oh, oh yes, oh yes, the writing was on the wall. Everybody kind of knew, because what was happening, we were starting to get imports, and as you know today, you go to a place like WaiMart or any of these places that they sell shoes, and you want to do your own research , try to pick up a pair of shoes that's made in the USA. I would , I'm not a gambling man , but I will give you odds that you may not maybe find one percent if you are lucky, because everything is either Czechoslovakia, France, Germany"
"RL:","India, China."
"NL:","India, China. China, a (unintelligible)."
"AL:","China."
"NL:","China, mostly China, and everything is made out of synthetics, very little leather shoes that they make today so. Consequently, it's a type of situation where you roll with the punches, and that's what happened . Same as the mills, everything went overseas, and even back then they were getting materials from overseas."
"RL:","Yeah, because when you were working at-."
"NL:","Clark?"
"RL:","No."
"NL:","At Bel Moe."
"RL:","At Bel Moe, they were selling -."
"NL:","That's another interesting thing."
"RL:","Didn't they open a factory in Puerto Rico?"
"NL:","Yes, they did. Because being in receiving and shipping, (unintelligible) as my wife just brought up, they started a factory, on account of the labor was so cheap in Puerto Rico compared to what they had to pay the American folks here in Lewiston, Maine. I recall taking huge barrels and filling all the components needed to make up these shoes. Now these (unintelligible) were pretty intelligent, pretty smart to be able to do this as businessmen, I would say. It wasn't helping our cause any. But sending all these materials to Puerto Rico, they would make up the shoe and they would return it here to the States-."
"RL:","To finish here."
"NL:","Yeah, which they call, was not completely finished . It was all put together, but what they had to do once it came back here, they took them out of the boxes, cleaned them up, polished them , stained them, which all you needed then was the packing room . Once you ran these through the packing room and you polished them up and put them back in the boxes, and most people, they know they were from Puerto Rico. They thought they were buying American shoes. But that was part of it. They could slowly start it back then , and with Clark Shoe, naturally, it was a question where the competition from overseas, they just couldn't keep up anymore."
"AL:","Yeah, and I think, they said at one time, Lewiston-Auburn was like the shoe capital of the world ."
"NL:","It was, it was. We, I can recall-."
"RL:","Way back when ."
"NL:","I can name, let's see, there 's one, two, three, four, five , six, seven , I know of at least seven factories that were here, shoe factories back then. But we're looking back in the '50s and the '40s, now. Even, well no, even further than that, because my folks haven't worked in the shoe factories , and I was born in 1935. My dad worked in a shoe factory."
"RL:","Yeah , your mother was born in 1918."
"NL:","So did (name). And she was, well she didn't (unintelligible) ."
"RL:","I know, but what I am saying is, she was very young when she started working too."
"NL:","Yeah, she was really, so. So back in the-."
"RL:","In the '30s."
"NL:","Yeah, back in the '20s and '30s, that's when a lot of these factories that were like in Massachusetts came to Maine. There again, it was a question with the labor, was a little less money, because you all had these people from Canada. Either they went to the mill or they went to the factory, and (unintelligible) to do, because just a specific job and that's what you did and you were proud of it."
"AL:","Did your parents talk to you about their time in the shoe shops, and did you all discuss how, your experiences?"
"NL:","Well, their experiences were a little tougher than mine, because the work, the wages weren't that high , and we were talking, you are looking at the time of the Depression now, and you're looking 1932, where things were really tough . There was no freebies out there like there is today. In fact, Social Security didn't start before 1935. So a lot of people at one time, during the Depression, were out of work, and the ones that went back to work, worked for whatever they could get. And these factory owners knew it, because when you had a job working at the shoe shop, you weren 't too independent, because if you were unhappy, take the door, there was a guy waiting in line to take your job. So, you know, this isn't the situation today. Now it's a tough time getting help, having experience at, my latter years working at Clark Shoe Company, I recall there was a young lady that was working in the office, and I needed a young lady for (unintelligible), for work in one of the departments, and she says, our hours were seven to four. So when you have fifty people in an office, I mean everybody comes in at seven to four, well, their stipulation was, I can 't come before eight thirty or nine o'clock. So you know, you can't start making exceptions, but what I'm saying is, you get to the point, you know, kids get more independent, they didn't care so much ."
"AL:","Did your time in the shoe shops, did you find that you developed friendships that lasted past your time there?"
"NL:","Oh, absolutely, absolutely. I've had one gentleman that was kind of interesting, because when I began about, let's see, when I went to, I left Bel Moe, I went to Clark Shoe, I must have been about nineteen years old I guess, and the gentleman that was working behind me, being an elderly gentleman that worked with my dad. So that was very interesting, so it was like instant friendship. Hey, I knew your dad , you know, and oh, then we were kind of kidding and we kind of hit it off. So we ended up doing hunting together and everything else. Just the fact he was older than I was, it didn't interfere with not having a good friendship with him. And there was a few others that you met. Then , back then , television wasn 't like it is today, and there was no computers, where kids spend their time with their computers. So in a, to answer your question , yes, there was a lot of friendships, because once or twice a year, somebody would organize having a deep sea fishing , okay. So a dozen guys would get together, we'd go deep sea fishing . Either that or, let's go smelting. Well, you know, we get out of work at four o'clock, and the tide's at ten o'clock tonight, okay, we're going to go fishing , spend the night in some little cabin , catching smelts. But that's what, you know, to answer the (unintelligible) and answer your question."
"AL:","And did you have the opportunity? And you were quite young at that time."
"RL:","I was quite young, and when I left the factory I was twenty-three, and then I stayed home and raised children , and I opened a daycare, because-."
"NL:","Yeah, they compensated her."
"RL:","He didn't want me to go back to work."
"NL:","Now we're going to start, (unintelligible) , not really, not really, it was, it was a mutual thing that we agreed for her to be home for the kids."
"RL:","Yeah, and then I did that for about eight years, and then I started working at home, stitching shoes at home, and I did it for twenty-seven years at home."
"AL:","Oh, wow, and who did you sell your product to?"
"RL:","I worked for a factory, and they, what do you call that when they bring in -."
"NL:","It was contracting work."
"RL:","Contracted work, so I still worked for that same shop. I can't remember what it was called, Fancy Stitches. Was it Fancy Stitches, Norm?"
"NL:","Yes, it was, yeah, okay."
"RL:","Okay, but I had it right there on the machine, the name of the company, because you know that my machine is theirs, right?"
"AL:","Right, oh , yeah ."
"RL:","The sewing machine that I used here?"
"AL:","Oh , okay."
"RL:","And it had been ten years that I hadn't done anything , so when I told Rachel that I had the machine, she says, well bring it over here, I'll take it. So, but I did work at home twenty-seven years, raising the three children, but I enjoyed that. So we did various works for different shops, and LL Bean, I did some work for LL Bean through them , and I can 't remember what else, what other factories that they brought in , what other companies."
"NL:","They were contracting to various factories. So that was a good deal, because they brought in -."
"AL:","Yeah , I didn't know they did that, subcontract out."
"NL:","Yeah, they brought her the uppers and she stitched the parts together, and they'd come and get them and complete the shoe at the factory."
"RL:","And the boss would come in and show me how to do the different styles."
"AL:","Oh, that's, I haven't heard of that before."
"RL:","You haven't? Oh , yes, there's quite a few of us doing that at home."
"AL:","Oh, that's a very nice way to do that."
"RL:","Yeah, it was."
"AL:","You can do it after the kids go to sleep."
"RL:","Yeah , well I mostly did it during the day, while the children , the three children were ready to go to school, so after they left, I went to work, and they didn't come home before three o'clock, and then I made dinner, and sometimes I'd have to work a little bit after dinner, but not too, too, too many times."
"NL:","It worked out pretty well."
"RL:","Yeah, it worked out good . I mean I didn't work forty hours, but at least thirty, you know, in the course of the week."
"AL:","Now, were you , did the companies you worked for ever have like summer picnics or Christmas banquets, or was that too late in the -?"
"NL:","No, no, to answer your, that question , you 're right, because back then they had Christmas parties, at least Clark Shoe did. I don't remember having any at Bel Moe, but at Clark Shoe, the owners, every year they'd give a big Christmas party for all the employees. And it was, you know, kind of interesting. It was a meal, and they'd have dancing, and it was unfortunate at that time, though it wasn't a place that you could bring your wife, or the, you know, the wife could bring the husband, but-."
"RL:","No, you didn't have any guests."
"NL:","It was okay."
"AL:","Oh , just employees."
"RL:","Just employees."
"NL:","That's right, just employees. Well, you can imagine, five hundred people, they'd rent a big hall and they'd give a big splash and so, but. And this is where you would talk about being friendly, well people knew each other. You worked together, you know. You spend more time at work than you did at home, when you came right down to it. But they did ."
"AL:","And you talked about, as your time at the shoe companies went on , you changed from more of a manual worker to management?"
"NL:","Yes."
"AL:","How did that progress for you?"
"NL:","Well, it progressed very well, but I'll tell you exactly how that happened . A few, a couple of years after I started, I had been at, that was longer than that, after I started at Clark Shoe, there was (unintelligible) on the line, like I mentioned a little while ago. The reason that I had an opportunity to get into the office, the owner of the company was. apparently was quite sick, hung himself. So at that point, it became a question whether the factory was going to survive or not, and we had this other gentleman that came in and purchased the factory, and came to an agreement with all the employees, if they would take a five percent cut the first year, that he would get it back to us, which he did later on , you know, that's to keep the company in business. But the thing that he also stipulated was, if you happen to be on a particular job and you weren't happy with that job, that he would give you the opportunity to better yourself within the confinement of the building, of the factory, I should say, I'm sorry. And basically, I took that opportunity, because being on piecework when you 're twenty-two years old, you know, I was pumping out ten cases an hour, on the type of shoe, that type of lining that I was cutting, while the (unintelligible), the gentleman behind me, that I thought was old at the time, at forty-five, was doing half that . So basically, I guess I was looking through the mirror into the future and saying, well wait a minute, this is going to be me in another ten years from now, or twenty years? So at that point, I applied for different jobs in the factory. There was one job, they needed a machinist. There was another job, they wanted a time study man, and the other job was working for the leather buyer, as an expediter, to start into purchasing. And the one that ended up being most attractive was going to be an expediter, and which led me later on to become a purchasing agent. And that's how that resolved , and I had that opportunity to do that. And what was kind of neat, because then you could, once you got into that position, you'd join what they call the Shoe Foremen, the Superintendent Association, which you were able to, they held a meeting once a month and, to let you know what was going on in other factories, and you met other gentlemen from other factories. So it made it quite interesting. There was, so it was a nice ride. So I enjoyed that."
"AL:","Are there things that I haven't asked you about that you feel are important to add?"
"RL:","I can 't think of anything."
"NL:","Such as? Can you think of any things that you haven't asked in a shoe factory. Well, I had , well, give you an idea of an opportunity, they also, in my case, which was very interesting, was the fact that I was still young enough to kind of get involved in this. The first thing the gentleman I started working for as an expediter, told me I'd have to learn how the shoe was made, and so having worked in the cutting room, which was up on the fourth floor of the building , that's the only place you, you can get up in the morning and go to work and you went to the fourth floor, and then you left and went home. But after he'd pointed out to me that it would be very important for me to learn, since I was eventually go into purchasing, to learn all about the component parts and how the shoe was assembled. So he, I remember him telling me to go in the back room and pick out a skin of leather and to make my wife a pair of shoes. So I says, okay. Fortunately, I knew her size, that was a big help. So I asked her what style she'd like, what she wanted me to, to have for her. She told me what she wanted . I remember it was blue pump shoe and kind of a plain, plain shoe with a two and half heel."
"RL:","Yeah, and, and these are the style that are coming out today. We went for our walk today, and I noticed the shoes. I said, oh my gosh, I used to have shoes just like that."
"NL:","So that was very interesting. So, at that point, after having one of the gentlemen cut, to cut the vamp and the parts to it, and the heels, I took it from that, from the cutting room down to the stitching room, where they assemble the shoe. And from that point, you take it down to what they call the lasting room , where they'll take that shoe and they'll wrap it. This form is like a heavy fiberglass , I guess, that they've molded to the, to the size that, of that shoe, and then it's run through the factory , where they will add , then you will go to the next level where they will add the sole and tack on the heel and trim it out and polish it, until they get to the, what they call the packing room, which naturally being the packing, this is where they ship out the shoes. So basically, by the time I got through, somebody handed me a box with a pair of shoes for my wife. And it was a great experience, because not only did I learn the, the basics of making a shoe, I also met a lot of interesting people on every floor and every department that had a foreman . I got to meet the foremen, I got to know who these people were, and that made it quite interesting . So that's a little, another little tidbit that I can add to that."
"RL:","Now, was your mother working there at that time?"
"NL:","No, by that time my mother had retired."
"AL:","Was there a time-?"
"NL:","That's another interesting thing. She just brought up my mom . My mom had what they call a sample foot, it's a 48 foot. So what that meant was, she had small feet. So when they made a sample and they wanted to see how that shoe was going to fit, she would go up to the cutting room, I guess, it was a special room there-."
"RL:","Was it a sample girl? Is that what they called her?"
"NL:","Yeah , yeah, they used to call them sample girls, and she was fortunate enough to do that, because as I recall with her, she had free shoes all the time, because she was a sample girl. And what they would do, they'd put the shoe on her foot, and she was able to tell them, well the vamp is too tight, or it doesn't feel well underneath the foot, or that the heel isn't right for this shoe. And she developed a feeling for this, I imagine, and they took her word for it, and they would make, you know, they would accommodate the shoe, so it would become a shoe that you could wear without developing corns. Another interesting thing, since we're on the subject of that, you had to keep, you have to realize , which a lot of people don't, they go to a store now, they buy a shoe, it's either small, medium or large. Where, back then , when Fancy made a shoe, they're what they call, there were different sizes of shoes and different lasts. Now, one last meant the type of shoe that it was. It could have been a shoe where it just had a vamp on it with an open toe and just with a little strap. Well , that style had a special last that would fit that particular shoe. Well that in itself is something. But now, we 're going to the point the shoe is made in A , B, C, D."
"RL:","Width."
"NL:","Width, now that's the just the width of the shoe, whether it was going to be narrow or wide. Then you also had your sizes that ran somewhere from five maybe to ten, ten and a half. They did make some larger ones, but not as many, naturally. But basically, we're looking for a size from five to ten. So now if you kind of visualize this in your mind, that one particular style of shoe, now they might have had, every season , they could have had fifteen , twenty, thirty styles of shoes that went out of the factory, and you start multiplying that with all the different widths and all the different sizes-."
"RL:","You had a lot of lasts."
"NL:","That was a lot of shoes. And it's, so it's something that, you know, that just went by the wayside."
"AL:","And what were your parents' first names?"
"NL:","Sorry, my parents' name?"
"AL:","Your mom and dad."
"NL:","I'm kind of nervous, I'm being stressed out here, (unintelligible) , Andrea. When Rachel listens to this, I'm sure she'll laugh . Laura ."
"RL:","Laura what?"
"NL:","Well, Laura Garnier."
"AL:","Your mom's name, and what was your dad's name?"
"NL:","Paul LeClair, Paul Bernard , but that's another story. They called him , Barney."
"AL:","Oh, he went by Barney."
"NL:","Oh, yes, yeah."
"RL:","His mother remarried , so that's why her name is Garnier."
"AL:","Yeah, well, do you have anything else to add, anymore stories that you can think of?"
"NL:","Now, I would have, I think -."
"RL:","No, you didn't even open your chart to ask the questions."
"AL:","Oh, I know, no."
"NL:","Well, there might be, but they wouldn 't be related to the shoe industry."
"AL:","All right, well thank you both very much."
"RL:","You're welcome."
"NL:","Yeah, okay."
