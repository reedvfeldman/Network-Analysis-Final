"(Interviewer:","Andrea L 'Hommedieu) January 17, 2009 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Workers Oral History Project at Museum L-A. The date is January 17th, 2009. I'm at the home of Larry Daigle in Auburn , and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu. Larry, could you start just by giving me your full name?"
"LD:","My name is Larry Joseph Daigle. I was born in Lewiston in 1943, St. Mary's Hospital. I was born on Cross Street. I was born at home, not in the hospital, thinking back."
"AL:","Okay, you were born at home and you lived on Cross Street."
"LD:","Yeah, that's where I was born, on Cross. On the corner of Cross and Oxford. Not too far from the Belmont Shoe shop, where my first job was. I went in as a, pulling tacks off the shoes and I (unintelligible) with my foreman and he gave me a chance to go out and sew, and I started on the, they had a second shift, hand sewing, at the time, they had a crew coming in at night, and I was going in sewing cripples, I started on. Roger St. Pierre was the one that helped me a lot. He passed away now, but he helped me a lot. He started me on that. Eventually I got into hand sewing, and that's why I started, at Belmont, in 1960. So, it's a long time. Then I went to work at the different shoe shops. I worked at L. L. Bean's and I worked at Sebago Moe, and I worked at Taylor Shoe, Commonwealth, oh boy, all these shops where the work was, that's where I went."
"AL:","Was it that places were closing, or that one place could pay you a little better than another?"
"LD:","Well, what happened , the work was slack, it was slow, so I made the move to go where the work was. That's the way I operated it. If it was slow in one area, I'd go look around for where there was work. When you had four kids, I had to work and raise the family. So that's the way I done it. Then I worked for Gene Cousteau , he was on Lisbon Street, as my second job. I'd sew all day and then I'd work for him at night. So, it kept me busy."
"AL:","Growing up in the Lewiston , Auburn area , you were born in the '40s, so you grew up in the '40s and '50s, and a little bit into the '60s, as a kid . What was the community like then? And, if you're looking at it as compared to what it is like today."
"LD:","It was, in the '50s and the '60s, I think was the best years, because there wasn 't as much crime as there is. If there were, we didn't hear about it that much around Lewiston , Auburn area. It was a very good upbringing. We had very good times. You could go somewhere and not worry about being attacked or people stealing your money. Those were the good years. That's my opinion of it."
"AL:","What did kids do for fun?"
"LD:","Well, we played kick the can . We didn't stay home. We didn't have no computers. We'd go outside, we'd play tag, hide-and-go-seek. We'd play through the yards. Now it's got the, where they had the Balloon Festival on River, when I was young, that was a playground for us. It was all wood area, and we played cowboys and Indians. That's where it was. Now it's all open up now, but in those days, that's where we played as a kid. Stayed off the streets and had a good time. It was very good , good upbringing. My mother had fourteen kids."
"AL:","Fourteen ."
"LD:","Fourteen kids."
"AL:","Where do you fall within the fourteen?"
"LD:","I'm the third from the bottom. I got brothers who went to war, World War II , Korean War, prisoners of war. Nine boys, there were nine boys in the family. Nine boys and five girls. I'm the cutest one of the whole bunch. I tell everybody that. When they see pictures of my brothers, they say, boy, they're better looking than you are. I say, well."
"AL:","Then your mother, of course then, was a stay at home mom, with fourteen kids."
"LD:","My mom, during the war my mom worked in Portland, in the ship yard."
"AL:","Really?"
"LD:","Yup."
"AL:","Doing what?"
"LD:","I don't know what she was doing. I know she worked there. I don't know what she did for work. I was just a kid . I didn't ask. When you 're younger you don't care."
"AL:","When you 're a kid you don't ask those things."
"LD:","She worked there for awhile, after she had all the kids."
"AL:","What did your dad do for work?"
"LD:","My dad, he was a lumberjack. He was always gone. He's from Fort Kent, and they moved down here in 1941. In 41 ', they moved down here from Fort Kent. They were supposed to go to Connecticut, but the vehicle broke down and they stayed over here, stuck in Lewiston."
"AL:","That's the story."
"LD:","That's the story and I'm sticking to it."
"AL:","So he worked in the Maine woods for many years."
"LD:","He worked in the Maine woods for many years, yup, and then he worked for the railroad as he got older. Then he worked in Connecticut, my father did , he worked on the railroad down there in Connecticut. He wasn 't a dad at home, he was always on the go. I knew my dad, I mean he was my dad, but God rest his soul, he was, you know, he did his thing."
"AL:","Now, you have pictures here."
"LD:","These are pictures of all my brothers. I told you I was the cutest one of the whole bunch."
"AL:","Am I supposed to pick you out then?"
"LD:","Yeah, I think you can . Look at it, I'm the, that was taken at my wedding in 1963."
"AL:","So, these are your parents and your sisters?"
"LD:","Yeah, there's my mom and dad , my two sisters on each side, and the rest of my brothers from the oldest one to the youngest one. There was two missing, two were deceased, they passed away, a sister and brother, so they're not there. But that's the picture of my wedding. He's passed away. He's passed away. He's passed away, and she passed away."
"AL:","That's a wonderful pictures."
"LD:","Yeah , I told you , I'm the cutest one, I bet you can see it there."
"AL:","I bet you 've heard that a lot."
"LD:","That's my wife and me, and she's been putting up with me for all these years, forty-five years we've been married . That's the balloon festival , when it started."
"AL:","1994."
"LD:","Yup."
"AL:","So, that was fourteen years ago, yup. I didn't realize it had been going on that long."
"LD:","That was one of the first ones."
"AL:","What do you play in the band?"
"LD:","I try to play the guitar, and I try to sing. Some people like it. You know, a person that sings, I think, you don't like his voice, when you hear yourself, you don't think it sounds that great, but other people think that I am . My hearing must be bad."
"AL:","What kind of music do you play?"
"LD:","We play country rock. A lot of the guys have passed away."
"AL:","Do you still have a group that you play with once in awhile?"
"LD:","Yup, once in awhile. Country Lads. We've been playing for thirty-three years."
"AL:","So, where did you get your interest in playing guitar and singing?"
"LD:","Well, my brothers, they played, I picked it up from them. We had home gatherings and they brought their guitars from Connecticut. My brothers lived in Connecticut. They came home and there was a family thing, and we played the guitar and sang and had a good time. That's how I picked it up. I saw my brother's guitar and I picked it up. We done good. I can't complain. A lot of nights I weren 't home with my wife, but I had to make a living. I had to go where the money was. The kids are all gone now, well, no, there's one back home. That's his little puppy there."
"AL:","Can you talk about the shoe industry in Lewiston and Auburn?"
"LD:","I worked at the Belmont. In the shoe shop, I met a lot of good people there, all hard workers. I tell you, I met some very nice people there. They were all hard workers, and the old timers, they taught me a lot, that had been there longer than I had. They always told me, you work hard , you can get something out of it. If you don't work, you don't get nothing ."
"AL:","Because it was piece work, right?"
"LD:","It was piece work. I had some good training. My brother helped me too. My brother, Vern Daigle, he's been sewing for forty-some-odd years. I don't know if you interview him or not."
"AL:","No, but somebody passed me his name the other day."
"LD:","He's been sewing for a long time. He's retired now, but he showed me a lot. worked at Belmont with him. A lot of these guys have passed away now, those old timers. They still have sewing around. They still have a couple of places around ."
"AL:","Falcon. LD : I don't think there's sewing there."
"AL:","Maybe not."
"LD:","They got Quoddy Moe, the old Peperill, they got Quoddy Moe, they're doing hand sewing in there. Matter of fact, I just saw one of the guys, and he wants me to go hand sew, if I want to go back to hand sewing. I said , well, maybe. You know, two pieces of leather you have, and you got a moccasin out of it, you 've got to make a shoe out of it. There's a lot of work to it. You 've got to have the right thread , the right needles, the right awls, make sure it's filed, there's a certain way to file that awl, so that it won 't cut too much . There's a lot to it. You take a lash and you take two pieces of leather and you make a shoe out of it. That's quite something. That's quite something. I'm glad that I learned that trade, because I used to love it. I used to love sewing. I made a living out of it."
"AL:","It's got to be a dying art."
"LD:","It is. You have to want to do it. You just can't go in and say, well. You've go to want to do it. You can 't just go in and say, well. The thread, and the tip, and the sole, and all that stuff, you 've got to put all that together, you 've got to make something out of it. It's not going to do it by itself. You have to want to do it."
"AL:","Do you have different recollections from the different shops that you worked in? Can you talk about your experiences?"
"LD:","Well , I worked at the Sebago Moe, Lamey Wellehan in Westbrook. Their type of shoes were good shoes. Very good. They had that welt, a different welt underneath, which I never sewed before that. That was an experience for me. It's different. It made a nice shoe. Then I worked at L. L. Bean, and I seen a lot of work there, in the boots they make, but we worked in hand sewing . We had to work in one area, and the other area, you could see where they made these boots, L. L. Bean boots. I met the old guy who had been doing it for years. I can't remember his name, it's a long time ago. He was telling me stories about Mr. Bean, Woody, they called him Woody, that was his name, Woody, a nickname. He'd come in once in awhile, not too often , years ago when it started ."
"AL:","Before they got so big."
"LD:","Before they got so big, yup. I never met Mr. Bean, that was before my time."
"AL:","So you did some work on L. L. Bean boots."
"LD:","Yeah, hand sewing shoes over there."
"AL:","Was it a lot different than other places?"
"LD:","Hand sewing is all the same. There's the pattern, for different styles of shoes, you get different styles. You have penny loafer, the moccasins, all different names. Just different types of shoes."
"AL:","But it's the techniques that are the same."
"LD:","Yup, it's all the same. Yup, you have different stitches on some of them. A lot are overcast, and some of them , the heels and sole, now today, I see at Quoddy Moe, they sew all around. It's quite something. I haven't sewed that yet. I think I'm scared to tackle that. But like everything else, once you do it. I might try it out. It's something to do for a couple of hours a day, if I want to go back to it. I used to enjoy it. You're your own boss, you make your own, you know, if you want to go fast. Today, I don't need to go fast, I just want to make a living, just for the fun of it. It would be something different to do."
"AL:","I apologize, because I didn't hear you , why you left hand sewing and went to the ship yard."
"LD:","Okay. I was working at the Billings Shoe in 1979, and I talked to Mr. Feinstein, he was the owner. I says, Jerry, I says, you know, the work is slow here and I was thinking of going to put my name in the ship yard. He says, Larry, he says, I don't blame you. You did enough sewing for a long time, he says, go for it, and good luck. We left on good terms, and I see him, he's still around today, and I talk to him once in awhile. He walks through that mall, Auburn Mall."
"AL:","Oh really?"
"LD:","Auburn Mall , every morning. He goes out there, he's what, his wife just died , he goes there every morning from eight to nine o'clock, he does his walk."
"AL:","So he would be somebody I could probably talk to."
"LD:","Definitely"
"AL:","He's not my list, but he should be."
"LD:","Mr. Feinstein, Jerome Feinstein. I don't know if he-"
"AL:","I can just ask him. I certainly won't pressure him."
"LD:","He was the owner of Billings Shoe."
"AL:","He was the owner."
"LD:","He was a good man to work for."
"AL:","So you put your name in and?"
"LD:","I put my name in at the ship yard, and a couple of weeks I got a phone call , went to interview, and I've been there since 1979."
"AL:","And you just retired."
"LD:","I just retired the last day of December."
"AL:","So, now you 're thinking about putting some shoes together."
"LD:","Well, for a couple of hours a week, a couple of days a week, just go back to it. enjoyed it."
"AL:","It would be nice to pass it on to the next generation, I would think. Obviously there had to be an occupation that a person could use the skills in, in order for them to be interested in learning. It takes quite awhile doesn't it?"
"LD:","It takes a long time to start making money. It takes a good year, and if not more. It depends on how you pick up things, because if you pick up fast, you know, hand sewing, you just can 't go there, you've go to know what you're doing. You can 't just go in there and make a shoe. It's a technique. Well, get back to that, when I worked at the ship yard , I got laid off, twice. I went back hand sewing. I'd go back probably six months or so. I had something to go back to. Thank God I had the shoe industry that I could go back and make a living. My French aint that great, but my language, I'm French so I speak a lot with my hands. Thank God I had the background that I learned hand sewing, because I went back to it twice. And I'm planning on going back to it now, just to, because I done it for quite a few years."
"AL:","Did you have a lot of friends who did hand sewing as well? I'm wondering what you saw, the impact of the closing of the shoe shops on people you knew. LD : Well, a lot of people, all they had was the experience of sewing, and when the work was slack, it was tough for them. Unemployment, you weren't getting that much money from unemployment at the time. They had to go work the labor outside in the summer time, in the winter time, it's tough , it's tough for them. The shoe industry, at the time there was a lot of them around, now there's only a few, not like it was. Like I said earlier, I'm glad the '50s, the '60s and '70s, that I was around . Those are good years."
"AL:","You mentioned some of the old timers that taught you , are there any that you recall their names, that really stick out in your memory?"
"LD:","Sure, they're all passed away. Joe Martin , Roland St. Pierre, he used to work at Belmont, and he started his own business. He was starting to make alternators and starters, he started his own business, (name), I don't know if you ever heard of that."
"AL:","Is he still alive."
"LD:","Yup, Roland's still alive."
"AL:","Roland St. Pierre."
"LD:","I'm trying to think of the guys, Ritchie had a lot of brother in laws who were hand sewers, Bud Ritchie, he passed away. Vincent Cloutier, a lot of these guys are all passed away."
"AL:","I like to ask about some of the old timers who have passed away, because unless people who are still living, who knew them during that time, talk about them, then we don't have any historical record of them."
"LD:","Right. I see what you mean."
"AL:","Did you know Bonny (name)?"
"LD:","Bonny (name)? Madeline Boudrie."
"AL:","There weren 't many women hand sewers."
"LD:","She was a hand sewer, Madeline, she was a hand sewer."
"AL:","I'd like to interview a female ."
"LD:","She was good. She was a hard worker. She was a very good worker. She kept up with the men too. George Vincent's wife, but she passed away."
"AL:","Well, thank you . Is there anything that I haven't asked you about your experiences that you 'd like to add, in terms of your times in the shoe shops?"
"LD:","What's nice about the hand sewing , it's piece work, and nobody's there to push you . You do your own thing , and that's what I liked about sewing . You had no boss on your back to produce. You did your job, you did your job well, and the boss, they didn't bother you. That's what I liked about it. If I wanted to work hard, I worked hard. If I wanted to take it easy, I could take it easy."
"AL:","When you talked about getting faster, as you learned the hand sewing , was that about being more efficient with the process, or I mean all the movements that you were going to make in making, can you talk about that?"
"LD:","Well , the movements, every move you make, you try not to waste time. Make all your movement count. Every movement counts, you can't go play with this, play with that. You've got to put it together, and the quicker you do it, and short cuts, you learn a lot of short cuts. That would come in time. You're not going to learn that overnight. And somebody else will show you, hey, if you do it this way, it would be easier. If you do it this way, there's certain tricks you can learn, but if somebody else knows about it and tells you about it, it's even better. My brother helped me a lot. He was a good sewer. He was fast. Not too many people could keep up with him ."
"AL:","This is Vernon?"
"LD:","Yeah, his moves were, when he made his moves, he didn't waste no time. And he could be talking to you and I, and I'll be behind him trying to keep up with him. Natural. So I learned from him too. You have to be careful, because that awl is very sharp, and when you punch a whole through that leather, you make sure you keep your fingers out of the way, because you can really do a lot of damage. Stick a needle under your nail. That happed a few times. You learn to keep your fingers out of there. But the shoe shop, I mean, I had a very good time, good time. I didn't live too far away from Belmont, because I lived right across the street. When I'd go to work, a lot of people had to leave their home at six o'clock to start by seven . I'd leave my house at five minutes to seven , and I was there at seven. I just walked across the street. I was lucky that way. I was always late anyway. At the shoe shop, you had to punch in, clock in. It was fun and excitement. I enjoyed it. I met a lot of nice people in the shoe shops."
"AL:","Great."
"LD:","If I have to go through it again , if I had to come back in this world, I'd go back. I'm not saying the ship yard wasn't all right, but they have the benefit. In the shoe shop, when you retire , you don't have nothing . All these years you worked there, no benefits. That's what Mr. Feinstein told me, I wish you could have some retirement. At least your going to have some benefit in the ship yard , but in the shoe shop you didn't have nothing. I had to work one day for insurance, the whole day went to insurance, and the other day for taxes, and the other three, that's what I had to live on. It wasn 't easy, but people, the French people, they stuck together. That's what's nice about the French people, they stuck together. They worked hard . Nothing was given to them. What they got, they earned it. The mills and the shoe shop."
"AL:","Were most everybody who worked in the shoe shops Franco American?"
"LD:","Yes. There was a few, some Italian people. But the majority was French. Hand sewing was a tough job, but you have to work to make a living. I still got all my tools. I got them right there, downstairs."
"AL:","Thank you very much ."
"LD:","Thank you."
