"(Interviewer:","Andrea L'Hommedieu) April16, 2010 Andrea L'Hommedieu: This is an interview for the Shoe Industry Oral History Project at the Museum L-A. The date is April 16th, 20 10, and I am with Kyle Rancourt in Lewiston , Maine, and this is Andrea L'Hommedieu . Kyle, could you just start by giving me your full name and spelling it? Kyle Rancourt: Sure, Kyle Rancourt, K-Y-L-E, R-A-N-C-0-U-R-T."
"AL:","And where and when were you born?"
"KR:","I was born August 13th, 1984 in Lewiston, Maine."
"AL:","And did you grow up in the Lewiston area?"
"KR:","I did, I did, right here in Lewiston, right off Pond Road , down the street. My parents grew up in Lewiston , been here, our whole family's grown up in Lewiston our whole lives, so, never lived anywhere else, except in college."
"AL:","Right. And so you were born in the early eighties."
"KR:","Yes."
"AL:","And so you maybe have a few memories of the eighties, but more likely the nineties."
"KR:","Yeah , much more vivid memories of the nineties, shoe business in the nineties."
"AL:","What did you see going on in the shoe business at that time?"
"KR:","Well, by the end of the nineties I would only have been sixteen years old, and my biggest concern in life was certainly not my parents' shoe company. So I didn't really know much. I mean I worked in the office and the factory and the warehouse, during the summers. We'd have a tent sale here in Lewiston, right at the factory , and I'd work at that. But- what do I remember?"
"AL:","And your grandfather was in the shoe business too."
"KR:","Yeah , he wasn 't around when I, as far as I can remember, because by the time I was old enough to remember these things and really comprehend what was going on in my family, he was already retired. So I vaguely remember he and my dad having Downeast Footwear, I guess I was probably five , six, seven years old. And I'm not sure if my memories are more from myself or from my dad telling me what used to go on. So I used to come into the factory, and the women in the stitching room, you know, they'd give me candies and I would hang out around there and just kind of run around the factory for a couple hours, especially on Saturdays, he would bring me. Then into the nineties my parents had Maine Shoe, and what I remember from that is the, what seemed to me to be a rapid growth in their company. I'm sure it wasn 't as rapid as I remember, probably more painstaking and time consuming for my parents, but since I was young and didn't have to worry about making a living, it seemed quick to me. They started off with twelve employees, I remember that, I remember they had the factory on Lincoln Street at that point, and I remember a big, empty building , you know, twelve people making shoes, a small amount of shoes. And it seemed like before I knew it, they were at Westminster over here, at the bowling alley, and they had seventy- five , eighty employees and busy all the time. But as far as the shoe making process or styling or the shoe business in general, there wasn 't much that I really knew about, or I really paid attention to at that age. It was when I got older. So again, from the nineties, I don't know much about the shoe business in the nineties."
"AL:","So when did you spark an interest in knowing more detail about what was going on?"
"KR:","Well, I always thought, my brother and sister, it wasn 't in their plans I guess, as kids, to be working for my parents or take over the shoe business. It was always in mine. I was the youngest and, I don't know, my dad and I have always had a really close relationship, and so I always saw myself taking over the family company. When they sold to Allen-Edmonds, those plans kind of changed but I was still very interested in the shoe business. So my, I guess you could say career or life in the shoe business began at the retail side. I worked in Freeport, at the Allen-Edmonds store there, when I was seventeen years old. It was I think my second job I ever had. I had worked at a couple other retail stores in high school, just part time. So I was working at the retail store there for a couple of years and through college, I went to school in Wisconsin and they have Allen-Edmond stores out there, because obviously that's where Allen-Edmond 's is based, in Port Washington, Wisconsin . And so my dad was working for the company, my mom and me, you know, we were all working for the same shoe company. I was at the retail level, and my dad was product development and management, and my mom, same thing, she was in management. And that's where I think I really developed a sense for shoes and styling , and the importance of shoes in people's lives. You know, for some people it's, me included, obviously, but even some people outside of the shoe business, it's like a treasure almost to them , you know, they have a pair of shoes or brand new shoes that they fall in love with, and they want to keep that for the rest of their lives. And they bring these same shoes they've had for twenty-five years back and they have them resoled and refinished . And so I realized that shoes were more important to people's, not just their wardrobe, but to their lives as kind of part of who they are, at that point, you know, when I was working at the retail level. Before, I didn't really see it that way. As a kid growing up I kind of saw, I saw it as a factory , you know, I didn't think my parents were doing anything cutting edge or fashionable, you know, I just saw it as building something, almost a service type thing . But I didn't realize how much of a craft it really is to make a pair of shoes. Yeah, so the retail side is where it began really, for me."
"AL:","Have you been able to observe over these later years, and your youth , the hand sewing and the art of that, have you ever tried?"
"KR:","I have not. And it's funny you ask, because I'm going to today."
"AL:","Today?"
"KR:","Yeah, because we have, right now downstairs we have a young man, his name's James, he's younger than me, he's twenty-two, twenty-three, he just came out of the military and he's a friend of somebody who works for us, and he's looking for a job and he's really interested in hand sewing, because the people he knows, they both hand sew. And so he's down there training right now, so it's a good opportunity now because somebody's training so now I can go and do it as well. Because you need a skilled , experienced hand sewer to train another hand sewer. So I didn't want to take the time out of somebody's day to train me to hand sew just so I could know how to do it, but now that I have the opportunity I would love to do it, so yeah, I will be."
"AL:","Because I see, as I'm sitting here talking to you and you 're coming on board with your dad and your mom in the business, and the art of hand sewing, a lot of the people in that field are quite older, because we lost so many jobs in th is area requiring hand sewers. And with you taking the baton into the future , that's going to be an important art, skill to train for and keep going."
"KR:","Yeah , I completely agree. This is a good topic of conversation, actually. Do you know what flat lasted shoes are, or welted shoes? Non-hand sewn shoes?"
"AL:","Right."
"KR:","So, those are the two, handsewn shoes and then flat lasted shoes, or welted shoes, whatever you want to call it, are the two primary most popular shoe constructions. And typically, flat lasted shoes are a dressier shoe, you get your plain toes and your cap toes and your wingtips, those are all made as welted shoes. And a hand sewn shoe is a moccasin type , it's very casual, and growing up, I never wore, didn't even wear boat shoes like I'm wearing right now, you know, it just wasn 't for me, it seemed like an older person's type of shoe. It's too- I don't know what they call it- I don't want to say it's too casual, because I've al~ys had a casual dress, but it was just, it didn't appeal to me, I guess it seemed too ol~ And it's funny how the tables have completely turned for me, because now that I started working here and see hand sewn shoes every day and I see all the different things that we can do with hand sewing and how we can make a really beautiful pair of shoes, better looking than a welted shoe or a flat lasted shoe, I think hand sewn shoes are the way to go. I wear them every single day, and I wear nothing else but hand sewn shoes out of our factory, and I just, there's so much potential there. And so it's extremely important for me, for my company and for the shoe business, to be training young hand sewers, otherwise that art will di~ There's a type of hand sewing, I don't know if you 're familiar with pre-punch? So, they punch the holes in the leather before they stitch it, and that way the sewer has a guideline to follow. But it creates this really kind of pre-packaged look, there's nothing really unique about the shoes. I mean , most people probably couldn't tell, but people in the shoe business and people who really appreciate shoes, and beautiful shoes, can tell that it's pre-punched. It looks, I don't know, it looks almost too perfect."
"AL:","Too uniform ."
"KR:","Yeah, too uniform, that's, exactly. (So you can train a hand sewer, anybody really, to do that, but it takes a certain person with right hand/eye coordination, and not just that, but to be able to stand there and stitch for eight to ten hours a day, you know, that takes a special type of person to be able to do that, very focused. So hand sewing is a highly tuned skill, and not everybody could do it, so it's a very impo)rtant part of what we're doing. So I'm glad we're training somebody, today, as we speak. l"
"AL:","And having probably heard from your family members over the years how much the shoe industry has gotten smaller in this area and the shoe shops have all closed, and the overseas sort of movement for a lot of people, how do you see surviving in that?"
"KR:","You might be surprised by this, but I don't see it as a bad thing, because I see it as an opportunity. Right now, there are less than a handful of shoe makers in the United States and we're one of them, and we're one group that has a lot of experience and can make really great shoes, high quality, beautiful shoes. So I see that as a vast 0 opportunity for us. I don't like the trend of sending all manufacturing in the United States, you know, regardless of the industry, to China or to South America. I mean, I don't see any value in that for Americans. But in this case, my dad always talks about, you know, back in the sixties and seventies, shoe factories and shoe companies were a dime a dozen, and so you had these shoe factories who were pumping out huge numbers of shoes on a weekly basis and selling them for the lowest price possible. You can 't build value in a good that way. You know, really, it's the lowest bidder wins and who cares what the quality of the shoes is. So I see this as a great opportunity, it gives us an opportunity not only to, we can get the price that we need to pay our employees well and buy the best materials, because there are so few American shoe makers, so we can get the prices we need to, like I -,.:::;;;;;; ~ said , pay our employees and also buy the best materials, and it gives us time to spend on making a beautiful product. Rather than worrying about getting shoes out as fast as possible, we can take some time, if the shoe's not right we take it back and we rework it, you know, we re-cut the leather, were-stitch it or put a new sole on it, if it's not right. So I see it as an opportunity more than anything. But I do want to say, for the record , I don't like the trend of sending manufacturing overseas. I'm certainly not for that."
"AL:","Is there anything that I haven't asked you that you might have particular perspective or knowledge on that you think is important to add? / I"
"KR:","The only thing , I mean there's so many, in my parents, my father especially and then in th is factory, there's so much knowledge that, I mean I really, I'm so inexperienced. You know, I know very little compared to what these people know, I mean they have spent their whole lives doing it. And so in one sense, well , nobody treats me like I shouldn't be here or that I, you know, they embrace it, they give me all their knowledge, so I soak it up. So I'm lucky, really , I have the best people teaching me everything I need to know about the shoe business. So I'm confident that in time, in the next few years, that I'll know as much as anybody about shoe making. But one thing I think I do have to offer this company, and possibly the shoe business, is a young person's perspective on shoes and on the shoe industry. And one thing I see happening for people my age is that, we appreciate good shoes, and we appreciate ""Made in America ,"" but we can't afford it."
"AL:","Yeah, how do you reconcile that, in the shoe business?"
"KR:","Well, there's a couple ways. We, one, are not going to be as greedy as some companies have been in the past, you know, marking up their shoes four or five times, so you make a pair of shoes for a hundred bucks and you sell it for five hundred dollars, to me that's just greedy. I mean , I guess there's many reasons why they do it, but is it necessary? Probably not. So we make a pair of shoes for a hundred dollars, and then we sell them for, say two hundred, because there are a lot of overhead costs now, we need to mark it up a certain amount to make some money, this is a business. But to keep that price point a little bit lower, so that people in our community can afford our shoes, and people in our, you know, my group of friends and peers can afford our shoes and wear our shoes, that's important to me. Because I'd rather see them in a pair of Rancourt & Company boat shoes rather than some Sperry topsiders made in China or India or wherever they're made. So that's one thing that's important to me going forward, and that might materialize in we have two separate collections. We have a collection of higher end shoes for businessmen and older people who can afford a three to three hundred fifty dollar price tag, and then we have shoes that are maybe a little less expensive, the labor costs are a little bit less, the material's a little bit less, so we can sell them for two hundred dollars a pair, so younger people and people who can't afford more expensive shoes can still wear our shoes. We don't want this , and we've said this from the beginning, this is not an elitist business, you know, we wouldn 't be here if it wasn't for this community and the people working in the factory. And so there should be nothing elitist about our company or our prices or anything like that. l Also, I'm really interested in the product development side and design, and I think in the same way that we need young people working here to continue this company, we need ) young people as customers to continue growing this company. If all our customers are ~ in their fifties and sixties, we'll be out of business in ten or fifteen , twenty years. So we ) need to really work on developing a younger following and a younger customer base, ( and that's one of our goals and one of my goals, so that's something that I really want to ~rk on and am working on currently."
"AL:","Great, thank you so much."
"KR:","Thank you."
