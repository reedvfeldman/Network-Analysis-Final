"AL:","And where were you born?"
"JV:","Here."
"AL:","Right in this home?"
"JV:","Sixty-four Genest, yes."
"AL:","And have you lived here most of your life?"
"JV:","I lived in Lewiston, but not over here. I moved back over here nine years ago. When Mom passed away, she gave me the house and I’ve been here ever since."
"AL:","And when were you born?"
"JV:","July 7, 1931."
"AL:","Nineteen thirty-one?"
"JV:","Yeah, seventy-four."
"AL:","What was the Lewiston community like in the ‘30s and ‘40s while you were growing up?"
"JV:","Well, it was very quiet and peaceful, and then it started to change. And besides that, it’s okay."
"AL:","Did a lot of people do their shopping down on Lisbon Street?"
"JV:","Yes, they did."
"AL:","Including your family?"
"JV:","My family did, yes. They used to go down the street once a week to go do the groceries or to go at different stores on Lisbon Street, which was very nice then."
"AL:","And what were your parents’ names?"
"JV:","Wilfred Jalbert and Adelaide Jalbert. 1"
"AL:","And did they grow up in Lewiston, too, or -?"
"JV:","They did, yeah. Except Mom was born in Brunswick, she was born and raised by an aunt over there, then they move over here to work at the mill. And she got married here in Lewiston."
"AL:","So both your parents worked, in which mill?"
"JV:","Not my mother. My dad worked at the Cowan Mill, he used to be a boss over there. And Mom never did work."
"AL:","How many brothers and sisters?"
"JV:","I had three brothers, and two of them passed away and I got one left. My husband passed away, too."
"AL:","Did your husband work in the mill?"
"JV:","Yes, he did for a while. But then he went to work at St. Mary’s Hospital as a male nurse."
"AL:","And, now tell me about your experiences working in the mill. How old were you when you started?"
"JV:","I was sixteen years old, I went to work at the Bates Mill until I was seventeen. Then they had to let me go because the law changed, that you had to be eighteen in order to run the machinery, so they just let me go for a year. Then after, when I turned eighteen, I went to work at the Hill Mill, and I worked there for twenty-eight years as a spinner. And that was the best job that I have never had."
"AL:","What did you like about that job?"
"JV:","I liked it because it was, well, I mean sometimes we used to get worked hard, and sometimes we used to have good times. And that’s where I learned to knit and to crochet, yes, but it was nice. I liked to do the spinning job."
"AL:","Can you describe what that job is?"
"JV:","It was a big long machinery with bobbins, and big roll from top, we had to tie that together, and then it started to go around the machine, and that’s what we used to do. Sometimes we used to run about twenty-three size, and sometimes twelve, it depends the things about the cotton, if it was big or small. But yeah, I liked it there. We used to have some good times. I used to work on the third shift and I used to come home and baby sit my kids, then go back to work at night. But one year they let me go, for one year, because I went to the hospital too many times. I went to the hospital four times in one year, so they just let me go. And the plant manager called me to his office, and he said, Jackie, we’re not letting you go because you were not doing your job. You’re a good worker. But the insurance, don’t have, (unintelligible word) you for the sickness, you know, you were sick all the time and that. So they let me go for one year. The exact day after one year they called me back to go to work. But I used to like to be a spinner, yeah."
"AL:","Did you also form friendships with the people you worked with?"
"JV:","Yes."
"AL:","Can you talk about some of those?"
"JV:","Well, I used to be friends with Theresa Turgeon, and Harry Morin, and one woman especially, I remember her, she was an English woman. She wanted to learn how to talk French, so I said, I’ll show 2 you. But it was not the right word all the time, you know, so one night she got mad at the boss, she went to him and she started to talk to him in French. She said, he said, where did you learn all those words? Well, Jackie showed me. He said, I figured it would be her. But we had good times, very good times, yes. But half of them, a lot of people are dead now, yup, so. Every time I take the paper, oh, I used to work with that woman at the mill. But I worked at the Hill for twenty-eight years, and the Bates Mill for seven years."
"AL:","Did you leave the Hill Mill and then go to Bates in later years?"
"JV:","Yes, when they started to lay off some people, they lay off me, you know, because they were closing down. Then I went to work at the Bates Mill, and I was going to be sixty years, well no, not sixty, fifty-five, and I started to work at a shoe factory after. But that was not like the mill, no. The mill was the best place, yeah, as a spinner especially. They put me once as a doffer, but the doffing was not for me. Put me on a spinning job and I could do it very good, but on doffing, no."
"AL:","What was harder about the shoe shop work?"
"JV:","The shoe shop, the people were not as friendly as the mill. And if you wanted to work at the mill, if you wanted to go talk to people, you leave your work and you go. But if you didn’t want to talk to nobody, you just had to stay in your work and that’s it. That’s what I used to like."
"AL:","I understand in the earlier years the mill sponsored social activities and things. Do you remember?"
"JV:","Social, yes, they, when I used to work at the Bates Mill, every year they used to put on musical show, or minstrel show, and I used to go and sing, at the City Hall. I sang twice, all alone. School Days, and My Happiness, and it was put on by the Bates Mill, and that was the best thing. Oh, we had a good time, very nice."
"AL:","Do you remember any Christmas parties?"
"JV:","That was not too, too bad, because I used to work at the night shift, and we used to leave there and, that’s it, you go home. But I remember a few times, people used to get drunk, you know, and that, yeah. But, I mean, to get (unintelligible phrase) to get rough and this, no, never, it was clean fun, yes."
"AL:","And were you ever involved in like the bowling league?"
"JV:","No, no, I didn’t. I didn’t have time to, I had to go home for my kids so I did not go out at night too much, because my husband had to go to work at the hospital, so that’s why."
"AL:","And how many children do you have?"
"JV:","I got four, three girls and one boy, and my son is a priest, he’s a Catholic priest, and he’s coming down Monday to do the baptism of my great grandson. And that guy is coming to take a picture over here."
"AL:","Mark."
"JV:","Mark, yes, yes."
"AL:","He’s coming here to do that."
"JV:","Yes, yes, and I said, he said, I’d like to have a picture from you and your son. Well, I says, I got three girls, too. That’s okay, just tell them to come. So I was happy to have all the family. 3 But it was nice, it was nice and clean factory to work for. Especially at the Hill Mill, I used to like to work there, yeah."
"AL:","Were there some people that you worked with, maybe in management, that you recall? That you could talk about?"
"JV:","Oh yeah, well, there was Lucien Poisson, he was a good boss, and Noel Poulin, Noel Poulin, he was a super boss, very nice, yes. And I know I was sick a lot, but they were good to me, they were very good to me, except once when they let me go but that was okay, I had to take it. But the plant manager said, you know we’re letting you go for a year, but it’s not because you were not doing your work. You were a good worker. So we’re going to give you a chance, you can collect your check on Lisbon Street. So I collected all my workman, yeah, because of them. But it was nice, yeah."
"AL:","What were some of the changes that you saw in the mill during the years that you were there?"
"JV:","Well, we used to work harder at the end. The beginning, we had a lot of fun because we were not overloaded with work. But at the end we were, we had a lot of work, a lot of size to work, you know, in that, and the work was so speedy, you know, so, going so fast that it was all getting busted and that. We were working hard, yes. At the beginning it was beautiful. But, I still went, yeah, I liked it there. So."
"AL:","I’m wondering if there’s something that I haven’t asked you about the work in the mills that you think is important to add?"
"JV:","I don’t really know. I think that’s about it. I used to go in to work at night, on the third shift, come home, stay up, take care of my kids, go to sleep a couple of hours at night, then go back to work. It was nice, I really did like it."
"AL:","Do you recall any strikes at the mill?"
"JV:","Yes, we, well we didn’t strike, we were going to strike. It came just about an hour before we were going to strike, (unintelligible word) changed their mind, they accepted the contract and we had, we went to work. And then one night when I was going in to work, there was a lot of fire trucks there. They had a bomb threat, and I was working way upstairs and the boss comes to me, he said, your job is upstairs, Jackie. I said, oh no, not this girl is not going up there if there’s a bomb threat. They were still there looking, you know, but I didn’t have to go. He said, okay, you stay down here with us. We had some good times, yeah. But I was not bashful with the boss, no, they did not bother me at all, they were all nice, respectable men, yes. I never had any argument with any one of them. It was nice."
"AL:","Did you ever get involved with the union at all?"
"JV:","No, no, nothing at all, no. I just pay my dues and that was it."
"AL:","Did you know Fred Lebel?"
"JV:","Yes, yes, he used to be at the Bates Mill. Yes, I know him. They used to live, his mom used to live on Stewart Street over here, yeah. She used to work at the mill with me, his mother, yes. A nice woman, very nice woman."
"AL:","Great, thank you very much."
"JV:","That’s okay."
